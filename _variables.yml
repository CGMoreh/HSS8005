    **This lecture** is a broad introduction to the aims of statistical modeling and the history of probability theory. 
    We will look back on the development of some core statistical concepts and learn about the ideas and preoccupations that influenced them 
    over three centuries. The aim of this overview is to build up essential intuition about the concepts and methods that we will learn about later. 
    The outcome will be a much clearer understanding of the limits of statistical analysis and the dangers of not acknowledging those limits.  
    
    **The IT lab**, on the other hand, will provide a very hands-on practical introduction to the {{< fa brands r-project size="1x">}} 
    statistical programming language and its currently most popular dialect -- the {{< iconify simple-icons tidyverse size="1x">}}`{tidyverse}` -- via 
    the <!-- {{< iconify simple-icons rstudio size="1x">}} !! Changed to HTML code to add colour --> <iconify-icon inline icon="file-icons:rstudio" style="color: #7dbefc;"></iconify-icon>**Studio** application programming interface. 
    The session will also introduce some other tools of literate programming and [plain-text social science](https://plain-text.co/) (such as {{< iconify ri markdown-fill size="large">}} / {{< iconify file-icons rmarkdown size="1x" >}} / 
    **Quarto**&reg; markup languages), all essential skills in contemporary computational social science and humanities research.

    In Edwin [Abbott's 1884 novella](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97), the inhabitants of Flatland are geometric shapes living in a two-dimensional world, incapable of imagining the existence of higher dimensions. A sphere passing through the plain of their world is a fascinating but incomprehensible event: Flatlanders can only see a dot becoming a circle, increasing in circumference, then shrinking back in size and disappearing. But a chosen Flatland native embarks on a journey of discovery and revelation - and ostracism and imprisonment. The story is an allegorical criticism of Victorian-age social structure, but can equally describe the limitations of inhabiting uncritically a methodological world in which all relationships between variables are seen as linear. Moving beyond linearity and acquiring the statistical intuition needed to think in higher dimensions and perceive more complex relationships is one of our aims in this module; but first, we'll revisit the arid plains of linear regression. Incorrigible procrastinators may want to check out [a full-length computer animated film version of Flatland on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfglluny8Z0&t=3602s) . Other may be interested in this brief [TED-Ed animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGv8MMi8QO0).

    Much of what we do in quantitative data analysis is about examining *relationships*. We are often interested in proposing and testing a model of a relationship between two or more variables. Sometimes our variables cry out to us begging for help, and we turn into agony aunts and uncles to our data. Other times we must psychoanalyze our data to uncover hidden associations and interactions. This is not an easy task. Do it carelessly, and you may unwittingly cheat yourself and the readers of your research. This week we'll build some intuition for detecting complex and uneasy relationships within the design matrix X  - that promiscuous commune on the right-hand-side of our regression equations. We'll expand on the additive models that we looked at in the previous week by considering interactions among our predictor variables, we'll explore the possibilities and challenges of asking causal questions of observational data, and we'll think about ways to avoid what evolutionary anthropologist Richard McElreath calls ['causal salad'](https://elevanth.org/blog/2021/06/15/regression-fire-and-dangerous-things-1-3/). We may get an uncomfortable feeling that we may have cheated with our Xs in the past, but we'll look towards the future. By the way, [Dear Prudence](https://slate.com/human-interest/dear-prudence) is Slate magazine's advice column; I like the name because being prudent really is essential in data analysis and interpretation. If you're done with the readings for this week, you may indulge in some Prudie advice on some more serious matters.
