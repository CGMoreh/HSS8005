    "section": "Exercise 2: Import external data",
    "text": "Exercise 2: Import external data\nAs we have seen in Week 1, small datasets that are included in R packages (including base R) for demonstration purposes can be used by simply invoking the name of the dataset. For example, the command head(mtcars) would print out the first six rows (cases) in the “mtcars” dataset included in base R (more specifically, in its “datasets” package). To access a dataset from a non-base-R package, the process is similar, however, we need to ensure that the package is installed on our system and that we specify the name of the package; for example, to access the starwars dataset (which contains all sorts of information about the characters of Star Wars films), we need to make sure that dplyr - or the whole tidyverse - is installed:\n\nhead(starwars) # gives an Error\n\nhead(dplyr::starwars) # works, as long as {dplyr} or the whole {tidyverse} are installed\n\nReal-life datasets, however, need to be imported into R. Datasets come in various formats. R’s native data format has the extension .rds and can be imported with the readRDS() function. The counterpart function saveRDS() exports a dataset to the .rds format. The core-tidyverse {readr} package has similar functions (read_rds() / write_rds()).\nThe .rds format is useful because it can be compressed to various sizes to take up less space, but can only be directly opened in R. It is much more common to encounter data saved in a “delimited” text format, which can be easily opened in a spreadsheet viewer/editor such as Excel. This makes it very interchangeable and therefore very common. The most common is probably the “comma separated values” (.csv) format, which can be imported with the base-R function read.csv() or the tidyverse readr::read_csv() equivalent. Read Chapter 11 in R4DS for more on these functions.\nVery often, you will need to import data saved in the format of another proprietary statistical analysis package such as SPSS or Stata. Large survey projects usually make data available in these formats. The great advantage of these formats is that they can incorporate additional information about variables and the levels of categorical variables (e.g. value labels, specific values for different types of missing values). These additional information can be extremely valuable, but they are not handled straight-forwardly in text-based format, spreadsheets and R’s native data format. To make them operational in R, we need a few specially designed functions.\nThe {haven} package — part of the extended {tidyverse}, meaning that it is installed on your system as part of {tidyverse}, but the library(\"tidyverse\") command does not load it by default; it needs to be loaded explicitly — is one of the most commonly used for this purpose. Functions such as read_sas(), read_sav() and read_dta() import datasets specific to the SAS, SPSS and Stata programs, respectively.\nIt is highly recommended to read the documentation available for the {haven} package to understand how it operates. Fundamentally, it is designed to import data to a intermediary format which stores the additional labelling information in a special format that allows users to access them, but not making them easy to use directly. A suite of packages developed by Daniel Lüdecke from the University of Hamburg offer some additional functionality to work with labels directly when summarising and plotting data. These packages integrate well with the {tidyverse} and are actively maintained, and we will use them in this course to make our lives a bit easier.\nIn a previous step, we have installed and loaded the {sjlabelled} package and the easystats suite of packages, which includes the datawizard package that contains a number of functions that make data(frame) manipulations easier.\nThe functions sjlabelled::read_sas(), sjlabelled::read_spss() and sjlabelled::read_stata() are the sjlabelled equivalents of the haven functions mentioned above. This vignette article included with the package explains the main differences between the two.\nThe more generic function data_read() from easystats’s datawizard package loads data from various formats based on the source files extension, including files from internet sources or compressed files. It relies on the rio package, which provides similar functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that by default the data_read() function assumes that numeric variables where all values have a value label are categorical and will convert them into factors. That means that all the numeric “values” will be replaced by the “value labels” (e.g. 1=“Yes”/ 2=“No” will become simply “Yes”/“No”).\nThis is usually a reasonable default behaviour, because the majority of functions in R do not handle “value labels” and working with textual (character string) values can be more explicit.\nHowever, this may be less appropriate when the dataset contains many long ordered variables (such as 0-10 scale items), as we will most likely want to treat such variables as numeric in statistical models. To cancel this default behaviour, we can add the additional argument convert_factors = FALSE. This is also the format that gets imported when using readRDS().\nHowever, most of the common tabulation and graphing functions will not show the category “labels” in the output either, and for that purpose having variables “converted to factors” (with the original “Values” overwritten by the “Value labels”) may be a better option.\n\n\nAs a first step, let’s import the osterman dataset that underpins the Österman (2021) article (see the Data page on the course website for information about the datasets available in this course):\n\nosterman &lt;- datawizard::data_read(\"https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005-data/osterman.dta\")",

For example, the describe_distribution() function from the datawizard package which is part of the easystats ecosystem that we already installed and loaded is useful for summarising numeric variables, while the data_tabulate() is useful for creating frequency tables of categorical variables.\nRun the commands below and inspect the outputs:\n\ndescribe_distribution(osterman)\n\nA very convenient way to create a codebook for a dataset – especially if it has value-labelled categorical variables – is offered by datawizard::data_codebook() function. The generated codebook describes the variables in the dataset and provides brief summary statistics. We can view this codebook in the RStudio Viewer, or we can save it as an html file. Codebooks are very useful for gaining an overview understanding of a large dataset.\nIn the command below we create an object storing the codebook; once it’s created, open the codebook in the Viewer and inspect it:\n\nosterman_codebook &lt;- data_codebook(osterman)\n\nWe can also generate and view the codebook interactively, without first saving it to an object:\n\ndata_codebook(osterman) |&gt; View()\n\n# or\n\nosterman |&gt; data_codebook() |&gt; View()\n\n# or\n\nView(data_codebook(osterman))\n\nThe result should be the following:\nProblem 1: Some issues when importing data from other software formats\nWe do notice a few strange values for some variables. For example, let’s inspect the ppltrst and dscrgrp variables in a little more detail:\n\nosterman |&gt; data_tabulate(c(ppltrst, dscrgrp))\n\nThe results in the frequency tables look good. So it’s probably something awkward about the labelling. We can check the codebook again; to allow for all levels of the ppltrst variable to be tabulated, we can change the number of maximum values shown from the default 10 to something larger:\n\nosterman |&gt; data_codebook(c(ppltrst, dscrgrp), max_values = 20)\n\nAs we see, the so-called “tagged” NA/missing values are causing the ordering of the values to be unexpected: because of letters appearing as part of a numeric value scale, the scale is automatically ordered following “alphabetic sorting” rather than “natural sorting”. R is not designed to handle “tagged” NA/missing values, but these are commonly used in other statistical software, and the original dataset was imported from a Stata/.dta format. In most cases this will not pose an issue, but it’s safer to convert all “tagged” missing values to standard NAs. We can easily do that with the zap_na_tags() function from the sjlabelled package:\n\nosterman &lt;- sjlabelled::zap_na_tags(osterman)\n\nWe can test the result to see if it is what we would expect:\n\n## testing the results:\n\nosterman |&gt; data_codebook(c(ppltrst, dscrgrp), max_values = 20)",

    "text": "Exercise 4: Descriptive visualisation\nCreate some basic descriptive graphs using the ggplot() command from the {ggplot2} tidyverse package for the association between the following variables:\n\n‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’\n‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’\n‘trustindex3’ and ‘female’\n\n1. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’\nThe best way to approach this problem is by working through the first examples in Kieran Healy’s Data Visualization: A practical introduction, starting at Chapter 3, and applying them to your data. Outside class, you can develop these basic graphs into better looking ones by adding various extra layers. The ggplot() function is part of the ggplot2 package, which is included in the core tidyverse, so we don’t need to load it separately if we have already loaded the tidyverse.\nThe ggplot approach to graphs is to build them up step-by-step using various layers. The basic template code for a ggplot() graph is the following:\nggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;, mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) +  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;()\nFor example, the code below sets up a totally blank canvas:\n\nggplot()\n\nThe result is the same if we specify a data-frame object only. The commands below are equivalent\n\nggplot(data = osterman)\nggplot(osterman)\n\nTo start populating the canvas we need to add a first layer containing the variables we want to ‘map’ using the aes() argument (for “aesthetic mapping”). This adds coordinates to the canvas based on the values of the variable we are mapping. For example, in the code below we ‘map’ the trustindex3 variable on the y (vertical) axis:\n\n# either:\nggplot(data = osterman, aes(y = trustindex3))\n\n# or:\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3))\n\n# or:\nggplot(aes(y = trustindex3), data = osterman)\n\n# but this is not sufficient, as the data is expected to be the first object by default:\nggplot(aes(y = trustindex3), osterman)\n\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3))\n\nWe now see the canvas partitioned by horizontal grid lines, equally paced within the minimum value of 0 and maximum of 10, which are the limits of the trustindex3 variable. We could also ‘map’ the trustindex3 variable on the x (horizontal) axis:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(x = trustindex3))\n\nWe have the same canvas as before, but transposed.\nIf we are interested in plotting the relationship between two variables (in our case, trustindex3 and eduyrs25), we can ‘map’ one on the y axis and the other on the x axis. The choice of which variable should go where is our decision, but because in our analysis we are treating trustindex3 as the outcome (dependent) variable, the convention is to position it on the y axis.1\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25))\n\nWe now have a basic layer, but no actual data. The next crucial move is to add another layer with the type of graph we wish to produce (called a “geom” in ggplot, short for “geometric object”, such as a bar, a line, a boxplot, histogram, etc.) using the + operator. For example, we could produce a histogram of the trustindex3 variable by adding + geom_histogram() to the earlier mapping code:\n\n# mapped to `x`\nggplot(osterman, aes(x = trustindex3)) + geom_histogram()\n\n# mapped to `y`\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3)) + geom_histogram()\n\nWe could also structure the command differently, by mapping the aesthetics within the geom function:\n\nggplot(osterman) + geom_histogram(aes(x = trustindex3))\n\n# or simply:\n\nggplot(osterman) + geom_histogram(aes(trustindex3))\n\nOr even separating the aesthetics specification out completely:\n\nggplot(osterman)  + aes(trustindex3) + geom_histogram()\n\nWhichever style we choose, we should aim for consistency in our code. Each may have advantages and disadvantages when expanding the function with various other more complex specifications for customising the graphs further, but we will not cover visualisation in that much detail in this course. Kieran Healy’s book on data visualisation is a good resource for ideas that you can test out.\nTo visualise the relationship between trustindex3 and eduyrs25, given that both variables are measured on a numeric scale (or at least on an ordinal scale with seven or more categories), the best option is a scatterplot. In ggplot(), a scatterplot “geom” is called with geom_point():\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) + geom_point()\n\nWe now have a scatterplot of the relationship between ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’. However, our data presents some challenges: our measurement scales are relatively short (length(unique(na.omit(osterman$trustindex3))) = 40 and length(unique(na.omit(osterman$eduyrs25))) = 26) and the data are spread out across all categories. As such, the points that we see on the plot actually represent a great number of overlapping data points. But does each represent the same number of overlapping points, or is there variation? There are a few tricks that we can employ to improve this visualisation. The function geom_jitter() (a shortcut to the specification geom_point(position = \"jitter\")) is helpful in such cases because it adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, making areas of overlapping points more visible. The commands below do the same thing:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\")\n\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_jitter()\n\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter()\n\nAnother useful specification in this case would be to add some level of transparency to the points. That would allow us to distinguish more clearly between the areas with more or fewer overlapping data points, giving a better indication of where the data is clustered and whether there is any noticeable ttrend in that distribution. We can add transparency to a colour with the alpha option. An alpha = 1 means no transparency (the default), while an alpha level closer to 0 represents higher levels of transparency. Given the large number of data-points in our case, a rather high transparency level of 0.1 is probably a good option:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\", alpha = 0.1)\n\nThere seems to be some positive trend in the way the data is distributed, but to get a better sense we can add another geom, geom_smooth(), which provides a set of options. This geom plots “smooth lines” representing various types of regression fit lines. The function fits a regression in the background and graphs the results. The default setting is to fit a generalized additive model that captures non-linearities in the data with a smoothing spline (the Wikipedia article on GAMs gives a maths-heavy outline of these models, but they are beyond our interests here). The produced output is probably more informative about the general idea:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nBut we can also specify other regression methods, and because we are here aiming to model the relationship between trust and education as a linear model, we can specify the method as “lm”:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nNow we get a straight regression line, which is basically the visual representation of the bivariate linear regression model that we will fit in Exercise 5 below.\nThere are numerous further specifications that can be added to improve the graph. We won’t go into much more detail about these additional options here, but as a taster, let’s say that we want to make the regression line more pronounced by changing its colour to red:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n\n2. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’\nWe can now do something similar for the relationship between trust and age (the ‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’ variables in the dataset). Again, both variables are measured on a numeric scale, so a scatterplot should work best. Because we don’t know what to expect and therefore what additional settings would improve each individual graph, we start from the most basic informative layer and build up from there. To practice some alternative approaches to working with plots, here we will first save the basic plot as a ggplot object, to which we can later add further layers and specifications:\n\nage_plot &lt;- ggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = agea)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nIf no output was generated from the command above, that’s as expected. The graph was produced, but we didn’t ask for it to be printed, we only asked for it to be saved as an object called “age_plot”. To see it, we can simply call “age_plot”. We can then make various additions to this plot.\n\nage_plot\n\nThis looks very similar to the previous graph, so we could add the same additional specifications as in the previous exercise, this time to the plot object that we saved:\n\nage_plot +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n\nThe association between age and trust appears very weak, something that we will explore further in Exercise 5.\n3. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘female’\nWe can try a similar scatterplot here too, but there may be better options:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)\n\nA scatterplot expects two continuous variables, but the female variable only has two levels (categories) numerically coded as {0, 1}. Because of this, the geom_point() plot type effectively treats it as a continuous measure with all values in-between 0 and 1 missing. We can see in the plot the variation across trust within each sex category, but it’s hard to get a sense of any differences between the sexes. We could - as we did before - apply jitter and transparency to the plotted values and add in a linear regression fit line:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n\nPerhaps this highlights a bit better how the geom_jitter() function actually works; it pulls overlapping data points apart, so that the areas with fewer overlapping data points (i.e. where the distribution is thinner) are more clearly distinguishable from the areas with more overlapping data points (i.e. where the distribution is thicker). Here it is much more obvious than in the previous example that the plot with the jitter is just a visual artefact: we, of course, have not created any new “sexes” with values of 0.4 or 0.6 in-between 0 and 1, even though visually that’s what we see.\nThere are various further options that we could add, for example we could change the width and height of the jitter, the alpha level, and even the number of break points on the x scale (to make the plot even more confusing):\n\na &lt;- ggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = NULL, \n              height = NULL,\n              alpha = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\", linewidth = 0.1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 0.4, 0.6, 1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"geom_jitter() defaults\")\n\nb &lt;- ggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.45, \n              height = 0.5,\n              alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\", linewidth = 0.3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 0.4, 0.6, 1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"w=0.45; h=0.5; \\u03b1=0.1\")\n\nc &lt;- ggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.5, \n              height = 3,\n              alpha = 0.01) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\", linewidth = 0.3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 0.4, 0.6, 1)) +\n  ggtitle(\"w=0.5; h=3.5; \\u03b1=0.01\")\n\nBecause female is a dichotomous/binary factor (categorical) variable, we would be better off using another “geom”. A good visualisation tool in the this case is a boxplot, which can be called with the geom_boxplot() function:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nThe issue with this graph is that the female variable, while a dichotomous/binary categorical variable, is not labelled; instead, the value 1 is taken to represent the “true” value for the name of the variable (i.e. 1 means that one is female, as the variable name states, and the value 0 means that they are not female, but male).\nWe could use the set_labels() function from the sjlabelled package to add labels to this variable:\n\nosterman &lt;- osterman |&gt; \n  sjlabelled::set_labels(female, labels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"))\n\nThe sjlabelled package also has a special variable type - as_label() - which is useful for forcing R to use the labels of factor variables in outputs. In the command below, we first change the variable type with as_label(), then we run the same ggplot(_) function as before:\n\n# We are overwriting the original dataset here, so we better not make a mistake:\nosterman &lt;- osterman |&gt; mutate(female = sjlabelled::as_label(female))\n\n# And from now on the 'female' variable will be treated as a labelled factor:\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox-plots contain a lot of useful summary information about variables, and the interpretation of the shapes is the following:\n\n\nbox-plot\n\nIn the case above, where we compare the average (median) level of trust across males and females in the data, we find that the two sexes do not differ much at all. We can also check a more precise numeric comparison; using the dplyr package, we could do:\n\nosterman |&gt; \n  group_by(female) |&gt; \n  summarise(Mean=mean(trustindex3), Median=median(trustindex3), SD=sd(trustindex3))",

The most basic information that we can obtain from the model is the coefficients:\n\ncoefficients(m1)\n\nThis basic information is enough to solve the linear equation underpinning the model:\n\\[ y_i=b_0+b_1x_i \\] The coefficients correspond to the \\(b\\)’s in this simple model, and we can plug the values in to obtain\n\\[ trust_i=3.91 + 0.11 \\times education_i \\]\nWe find, thus, that the number of years spent in education has a positive outcome on social trust, with each additional year of education associated with a 0.11-points higher score on the trust index, above the baseline of 3.91 points in the case when education is equal to 0. With this formula we can calculate predictions of the trust score for any individual \\(i\\) from their years of education.\nWe can also get more information about the model with the summary() function. When applied to a linear model object, it provides the following output:\n\nsummary(m1)\n\nThis output tells us a lot more about the fitted model, for example a summary table of the residuals and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) summary of the residuals, as well as estimates of variation for our coefficients (the standard errors and the p-values associated with t-tests - displayed as Pr(&gt;|t|)).\nWhile these are informative, the format is not ideal for further manipulation and presentation. Several user-written functions exist to improve on this output. For example, the {broom} package - part of the {tidymodels} suite of packages - has functions to extract model information into “tidy” tibbles (data sets), which can then be further manipulated and plotted. This is especially useful when working with results from many models that would benefit from comparing in a standardised format.\nThe summary() function prints out a lot of information, but it’s not the best format if we wish to reuse the various statistical components for further analysis, and the presentation of the output could also be improved. The model_parameters() and the model_performance() functions from the parameters package part of easystats is a better option:\n\nmodel_parameters(m1) \n\nmodel_performance(m1)\n\nThe output table shows both 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the standard errors (SE), which can be easier to interpret (CI are calculated as Estimate +/- (1.96 x Std. Error); you can try it out in the Console, replacing in the numeric values).\nThe best approach is to graph the model results and present them in a figure, but that’s not very informative in the case of a simple model with only one predictor, so we can leave it for later.\n2. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘agea’ and interpret the results\nWe can do as above:\n\n# Write your own code; name the mode \"m2\"\n\n3. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘female’ and interpret the results\n\n# Write your own code; name the model \"m3\"\n\n4. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on all three predictors listed above and interpret the results\nFinally we can fit a multiple linear model with several predictors:\n\n# Write your own code; name the model \"m4\"\n\nOne interesting finding from Model 4 is to notice how radically the statistical significance of the female variable changes compared to Model 3. The impact of gender is still very weak in real terms: compared to men of similar age and education level, women score 0.04 points higher on the trust scale; but this is still a stronger effect than in the simple bivariate model (where \\(b_1\\) was 0.008), and our confidence intervals are much narrower.\nIt’s worth noticing that the number of observations used in the two models is not the same, due to missing values in some variables. We could make the samples comparable by selecting out the sample of 68,211 included in Model 4, then refitting Model 3 on that sample only:\n\nsample &lt;- m4$model\n\nm3_new &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ female, data = sample)\n\nmodel_parameters(m3) \n\nWe see that this does not affect the overall picture.",

The most important missing information required to complete this exercise is to be found in the description on how the trustindex3 scale was computed:\n\nTo study generalized social trust, I am following the established approach of using a validated three-item scale (Reeskens and Hooghe 2008; Zmerli and Newton 2008). This scale consists of the classic trust question, an item on whether people try to be fair, and an item on whether people are helpful:  - ‘Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?’  - ‘Do you think that most people would try to take advantage of you if they got the chance, or would they try to be fair?’  - ‘Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or that they are mostly looking out for themselves?’  All of the items may be answered on a scale from 0 to 10 (where 10 represents the highest level of trust) and the scale is calculated as the mean of the three items. The three-item scale clearly improves measurement reliability and cross-country validity compared to using a single item, such as the classic trust question. … See the Supplementary material for additional information on the construction of the social trust scale (Section A.1), as well as for models using the classic single-item measure of trust (Section A.9).",

    "text": "Introduction\nThis session explores examples of interactions in regression models. We will look more closely at some of the multiple regression models we have fit in previous labs and ask whether the effects of core explanatory variables could be said to depend on (or are conditioned on) the values of other explanatory variables included in the model. In practice, this will involve including the product of two explanatory variables in the model. Thus, taking a regression model of the generic form \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\epsilon\\), we ask whether there is an interaction between variables \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) (i.e. whether the effect of one depends on the values of the other) by fitting a model of the form \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\color{green}{\\beta_3(X_1 \\times X_2)} + \\epsilon\\), where we are interested in the “interaction effect” represented by \\(\\beta_3\\).\nWhile fitting such interaction models is simple in practice, understanding when they are needed, interpreting, and communicating their results can be challenging, and a growing literature in the social sciences has explored best practices in relation to such models (Berry, Golder, and Milton 2012; Brambor, Clark, and Golder 2006; Clark and Golder 2023; Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu 2019). Advancements in software have also made it easier to interpret and present results from interaction models, with some notable R packages entering this space over the past few years; we have already encountered the marginaleffects and ggeffects packages when visualising results from logistic regression models, and examining results from interaction models presents very similar challenges. In this week’s lab we will use some of these tools to undertake comprehensive analyses of interaction effects.\nWe have already encountered interactions in all of the application readings we have engaged with so far. However, they mostly involved more complex cases of interactions, whose understanding will first require a more basic knowledge of how interaction effects work and how they can be implemented in practice. Wu (2021) and Dingemans and Van Ingen (2015) make use of “cross-level” interactions, which we will revisit when learning about multilevel models (Week 6). Mitchell (2021) uses higher-level interactions on data aggregated at country level as an additional analysis to their main models, while Österman (2021) operates with a quasi-experimental design in which the interaction effect is taken to divulge a more directly causal effect the data. This latter example is “more complex” only at a conceptual and study design level, and we will replicate it in the lab exercises. However, we begin by looking at a conceptually less involved example where interaction effects are at the core of the analysis, also from the field of social trust research.",

    "text": "Example 1. Akaeda (2023): Are preferences for redistribution associated with education in European countries, and is the association moderated by social trust?\n\nThe research question in the title of this exercise relates directly to the research reported by Akaeda (2023). Following a detailed review of the literature on the relationship between attitudes towards redistribution, education, and social- and institutional trust, the author derives a hypothesis they want to investigate: “trust decreases the gap in preferences for redistribution due to education” (p. 296). They break down the hypothesis into two parts, one relating to social trust and the other to institutional trust.\nAkaeda (2023) combine data from several waves of the World Values Survey (WVS) and the European Values Study (EVS) to test this research hypothesis. Their combined dataset contains data on “74 countries, 26 years, 259 country-years, and 254,214 individuals”. Their interest is in modelling the hypothesised relationship on a global level, accounting both for various individual explanatory variables as well as macro-societal factors at the level of countries and country-years (i.e. change over time within countries).\nHere we will attempt to fit a simpler version of their “Model 3” (reported in Table 2). In terms of data, we focus specifically on “European” countries; for this purpose, we will use data from the latest wave of the European Values Study survey. In terms of variable selection and transformations, we will roughly follow Akaeda (2023), with some adjustments for convenience. Akaeda (2023:297–98) describe their variable selection procedure in these words:\n\n\nthe dependent variable is the score of preferences for redistribution. This score is based on a question … that asks respondents to indicate on a scale from 1 to 10 whether ‘Incomes should be made more equal (1)’ or ‘We need larger income differences as incentives for individual effort (10)’. In accordance with previous research, the scores were reversed such that a higher score indicates stronger support for redistribution;\nthe level of education is a key independent variable because the association between education and support for redistribution is a main focus of this study. Because previous studies have shed light on the mechanisms of university education related to a conservative view of redistribution, this analysis adopts the dummy for university or higher degree as an independent variable;\nas a key moderator variable … social trust as measured by the question, ‘Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?’, which had the following two potential responses: ‘1. Most people can be trusted’, ‘2. Need to be very careful’. Based on previous research involving social trust, this analysis employs the dummy for social trust (1 = ‘Most people can be trusted’);\nthe following individual-level controls: gender (1 = female, 0= male), age, age squared, employment status (employed, self-employed, unemployed, retired, other), household income (z scored for country-year units, marital status (married = 1), child (having child = 1), and political orientation (1 = right to 10 = left)\n\n\nData preparation\nThe original data is freely accessible from the European Values Study website in various formats. For the purposes of this lab, we can also access a lightly edited dataset in native .Rds format from the Data page (evs2017.rds). We can either download the dataset to a local data folder and load it from there, or loaded directly from the web:\n\nevs &lt;- datawizard::data_read(\"https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005/data/evs2017.rds\")\n\nOnce the data is loaded in the workspace environment, we can select the variables that we are interested in, inspect them in a codebook and apply any necessary transformations:\n\n# Select the variables needed:\n\nevs &lt;- evs |&gt; \n  select(v106,      # redistribution pref.\n         v243_r,    # education\n         v31,       # social trust\n         v225,      # sex/gender\n         age,\n         v244,      # employment status\n         v261_ppp,  # household income (corrected)\n         v234,      # marital status\n         v239_r,    # number of children\n         v102,      # political orientation (1=left...10=right)\n         )\n\nView the codebook for the selected variables:\n\ndata_codebook(evs) |&gt; View()\n\nRecode variables to match Akaeda (2023) as closely as possible:\n\nakaeda &lt;- evs |&gt; \n  data_modify(redistribute = reverse(v106),\n              # recode education to a binary; \n              # treat the original variable as a numeric variable in the process to allow referring to numeric codes rather than the long text labels\n              educ_univ = recode_values(as_numeric(v243_r),\n                                   recode = list(\"1\" = 3,\n                                                 \"0\" = c(1, 2, 4))),\n              # inverse to make \"most people can be trusted\" the second (indicator) category\n              trusting = recode_values(as_numeric(v31),\n                                       recode = list(\"1\" = 1,\n                                                     \"0\" = 2)),\n              # just rename as \"female\" is already the second category\n              female = v225,\n              # recode \"employment\" as a factor/categorical (without treating it as numeric and adding labels later)\n              employment = recode_values(v244,\n                                         recode = list(\"Employed\" = c(\"30h a week or more\", \n                                                                      \"less then 30h a week\"), \n                                                       \"Self-employed\" = \"self employed\", \n                                                       \"Unemployed\" = \"unemployed\", \n                                                       \"Retired\" = \"retired/pensioned\", \n                                                       \"Other\" = c(\"military service\", \n                                                                   \"homemaker not otherwise employed\", \n                                                                   \"student\", \n                                                                   \"disabled\", \n                                                                   \"other\"))),\n              hh_income = v261_ppp,\n              # recoding marital status as numeric\n              married = recode_values(as_numeric(v234),\n                                      recode = list(\"1\" = 1,\n                                                    \"0\" = 2:6)),\n              \n              child = recode_values(v239_r,\n                                    recode = list(\"0\" = 1,\n                                                  \"1\" = 2:6)),\n              politics = reverse(v102)\n              ) |&gt; \n  set_labels(married, labels = c(\"Not married\", \"Maried\")) |&gt; \n  set_labels(trusting, labels = c(\"Not trusting\", \"Trusting\")) |&gt; \n  set_labels(educ_univ, labels = c(\"No university education\", \"University education\")) |&gt; \n  set_labels(child, labels = c(\"No children\", \"Has children\")) |&gt; \n  # Treat them as factors again for better reporting of labels\n  to_label(married, trusting, educ_univ, child, married)\n\nView the codebook for the recoded dataset:\n\ndata_codebook(akaeda) |&gt; View()\n\nRelationships between the main variables of interest\nFollowing Akaeda (2023), the main variables of interest are redistribute, educ_univ and trusting. We can inspect some basic relationships between them using boxplots and cross-tabulations:\n\n# Boxplots:\n\ngf_boxplot(redistribute ~ educ_univ, data = akaeda)\ngf_boxplot(redistribute ~ trusting, data = akaeda)\n\n# Cross-tabulations:\n\n# To check the values of a categorical variable by another categorical variable, a contingency table (cross-tabulation) is preferable.\n# Native R is not very good at cross-tabulations; there are some better user-written functions, but only relying on packages we have already used so far,\n# some options are:\n\n## In base R (table):\n### Simple frequencies\ntable(akaeda$educ_univ, akaeda$trusting)\n### Frequencies with added row marginal totals\ntable(akaeda$educ_univ, akaeda$trusting) |&gt; addmargins(margin = 2)\n### Proportions, by row\ntable(akaeda$educ_univ, akaeda$trusting) |&gt; prop.table(margin = 1)\n### Proportions, by column with added column marginal totals\ntable(akaeda$educ_univ, akaeda$trusting) |&gt; prop.table(margin = 2) |&gt; addmargins(margin = 1)\n\n\n## In base R (xtabs - formula style):\nxtabs(~ educ_univ + trusting, data = akaeda)\n#### Proportions by column, rounded to 2 decimals, added column marginal totals\nxtabs(~ educ_univ + trusting, data = akaeda)|&gt; prop.table(margin = 2) |&gt; round(2) |&gt; addmargins(margin = 1)\n\n## In tidyverse (dplyr + tidyr)\n### Frequencies\nakaeda |&gt; \n  group_by(educ_univ, trusting) |&gt; \n  summarise(n=n()) |&gt; \n  spread(trusting, n)\n### Proportions\nakaeda |&gt; \n  group_by(educ_univ, trusting) |&gt; \n  summarise(n=n()) |&gt; \n  mutate(prop=n/sum(n)) |&gt; \n  subset(select=c(\"educ_univ\",\"trusting\",\"prop\")) |&gt; \n  spread(trusting, prop)\n  # or, for % of education by trust:\n  # spread(educ_univ, prop)\n\n\n## In {datawizard}:\n### Both frequencies and % in a listing format rather than crosstabulated\nakaeda |&gt; \n  data_group(educ_univ) |&gt;\n  data_tabulate(trusting, collapse = TRUE)\n\n\n## In {gtsummary}:\nakaeda |&gt; \n  gtsummary::tbl_cross(educ_univ, trusting,\n                     percent = \"row\",\n                     missing = \"no\")\n\nMultiple regression model without interaction terms\nOur dependent variable (redistribute) can be treated as numeric, so we will fit a linear (ordinary least squares) regression model using the lm() function:\n\nm1 &lt;- lm(redistribute ~ educ_univ + trusting + female + employment + hh_income + married + child + politics, data = akaeda)\n\nLet’s then check the model coefficients (parameters):\n\nmodel_parameters(m1)\n\nModel with an interaction between education and social trust\n\nWe can interact predictor variables in regression models using the : and * operators. With :, we include in the regression model only the interaction term, but not the component variables (i.e. their main effects); to include the component variables as well, we need to add them in as usual with the + operator. To note that we should normally want to include both main effects and and the interaction effects in a regression model. With *, we include both the main effects and the interaction effects, so it provides a shortcut to using :, but it is often useful to combine the two in more complex interaction scenarios.\nThe specifications below are equivalent:\n\n# Interaction using \":\"\n# including the constituent terms must be done manually\nm2 &lt;- lm(redistribute ~ educ_univ + trusting + educ_univ:trusting + female + employment + hh_income + married + child + politics, data = akaeda)\n\n# Interaction using \"*\"\n# including the constituent terms is done automatically\nm2 &lt;- lm(redistribute ~                        educ_univ*trusting + female + employment + hh_income + married + child + politics, data = akaeda)\nm2 &lt;- lm(redistribute ~ educ_univ + trusting + educ_univ*trusting + female + employment + hh_income + married + child + politics, data = akaeda)\n\nBut the one below is missing the constituent terms and is very likely not what we want:\n\nm2_wrong &lt;- lm(redistribute ~                  educ_univ:trusting + female + employment + hh_income + married + child + politics, data = akaeda)\n\nOut of precaution, it is advisable to use the * operator and to manually include all the constituent terms as well, as in the third version above.\nLet’s then check the model coefficients (parameters):\n\nmodel_parameters(m2)\n\nWe can compare our results with those reported in Model 3 (Table 2) of Akaeda (2023), keeping in mind that our data are very different. Nonetheless, we find a similar positive effect for the interaction term (0.41), which in our case is stronger.\nInterpreting interactions\nAs with results from logistic regression models, interpreting interaction results is not straightforward.\nFirst of all, the coefficients associated with the individual variables included in the interaction term can no longer be interpreted in the usual direct way, and we usually no longer interpret the “main effects” of educ_univ and trusting, but only the multiplicative effect of the interaction between them. The interpretation of the numeric results, however, is rather convoluted and prone to lead to misinterpretations. In essence, what we get is the effect of a unit-change in trust among the university-educated compared to the effect of a unit-change in trust among the non-university-educated.\nAs with interpreting logistic regression, it can be much easier and reliable to interpret a plot of the “marginal effects”. As we already know from Lab 4, that can be achieved using the ggpredict() and the plot() functions, and we would add both constitutive terms of the interaction. Depending on which variable we write first we get either the effect of trust by education, or the effect of education by trust:\nEducation by trust:\n\nggpredict(m2, terms = c(\"educ_univ\", \"trusting\")) |&gt; \n  plot()\n\nTrust by education:\n\nggpredict(m2, terms = c(\"trusting\", \"educ_univ\")) |&gt; \n  plot()\n\nThe latter plot reproduces Figure 1 from Akaeda (2023). To get an even closer reproduction of that Figure, we could add an additional argument to the plotting function, asking for the point-predictions to be connected with lines:\n\nggpredict(m2, terms = c(\"trusting\", \"educ_univ\")) |&gt; \n  plot(connect.lines = TRUE)\n\nLooking at whether and how much the confidence intervals of the predicted coefficients overlap with the point-predictions of the coefficients, we can visually asses the interaction effect. We find that positive differences in the level of social trust have a much steeper effect on redistributive attitudes among the highly educated than it does among the lower educated.",

    "text": "The RStudio interface\nThe RStudio interface consists of four main panes (which can be customised to some degree):\n\nThe R Console Pane\nThe R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R “engine”. This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. The Console is the direct interface to the R software itself; it’s what we get if instead of RStudio we open the R software: a direct interface to the R programming language, where we can type commands and where results/messages are printed.\nYou can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script. For this reason, we should not use the Console pane directly too much, ad reserve it only for quick and dirty calculations and checks. For typing commands that we want R to execute, we should instead use an R script file, where everything we type can be saved for later and complex analyses can be built up.\nThe Source Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-left, is a space to work with scripts and other text files. This pane is also where datasets (data frames) open up for viewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your RStudio displays only one pane on the left, it is because you have no scripts open yet. We can open an existing one or create a new one. We’ll do that a bit later.\n\n\nThe Environment Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of “objects” that are available in an active session. Datasets loaded for analysis would appear here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your Environment is empty, it means that you don’t have any “objects” loaded or created yet. We will be creating some objects later and we will also import an example dataset.\n\n\nFiles, Plots, Packages, Help, etc. The lower-right pane includes several tabs including plots (display of graphics including maps), help, a file library, and available R packages (including installation/update options).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can arrange the panes in various ways, depending on your preferences, using Tools &gt; Global Options in the top menu. So the arrangement of panes may look different on different computers.",

    "text": "Scripts, markdown documents and projects\nWriting brief commands that you want to test out in the Console is okay, but what you really want is to save your commands as part of a workflow in a dedicated file that you can reuse, extend and share with others.\nIn every quantitative analysis, we need to ensure that each step in our analysis is traceable and reproducible. This is increasingly a professional standard expected of all data analysts in the social sciences. This means that we need to have an efficient way in which to share our analysis code, as well as our outputs and interpretations of our findings. RStudio has an efficient way of handling this requirement with the use of R script files and versions of the Markdown markup language that allow the efficient combining of plain text (as in the main body of an article) with analysis code and outputs produced in R. The table below lists the main characteristics of these file types:\n\n\nFormat\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\nR Script\n.R\nUse an R script if you want to document a large amount of code used for a particular analysis project. Scripts should contain working R commands and human-readable comments explaining the code. Commands can be run line-by-line, or the whole R script can be run at once. For example, one can write an R script containing a few hundred or thousands of lines of code that gathers and prepares raw, unruly data for analysis; if this script can run without any errors, then it can be saved and sourced from within another script that contains code that undertakes the analysis using the cleansed dataset. Comments can be added by appending them with a hashtag (#).\n\n\nR Markdown\n.Rmd\n\nMarkdown is a simple markup language that allows the formatting of plain text documents. R Markdown is a version of this language written by the R Studio team, which also allows for R code to be included. Plain text documents having the .Rmd extension and containing R Markdown-specific code can be “knitted” (exported) directly into published output document formats such as HTML, PDF or Microsoft Word, which contain both normal text as well as tables and charts produced with the embedded R code. The code itself can also be printed to the output documents.\n\n\nQuarto document\n.qmd\nQuarto is a newer version of R Markdown which allows better compatibility with other programming languages. It is a broader ecosystem design for academic publishing and communication (for example, the course website was built using quarto), but you will be using only Quarto documents in this module. There isn’t much difference between .Rmd and .qmd documents for their uses-cases on this module, so one could easily change and .Rmd extension to .qmd and still produce the same output. .qmd documents are “rendered” instead of “knitted”, but for RStudio users the underlying engine doing the conversion from Quarto/R Markdown to standard Markdown to output file (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) is the same. Read more about Quarto document in the TSD textbook.\n\n\n\nCreating new files can be done easily via the options File &gt; New File &gt; from the top RStudio menu.\nThe best way to use these files are as part of R project folders, which allow for cross-references to documents and datasets to be made relative to the path of the project folder root. This makes sure that no absolute paths to files (i.e. things like “C:/Documents/Chris/my_article/data_files/my_dataset.rds”) need to be used (instead, you would write something like “~/data_files/my_dataset.rds” if the “my_article” folder was set up as an R Project). This allows for the same code file to be run on another computer too without an error, ensuring a minimal expected level of reproducibility in your workflow.\nSetting up an existing or a new folder as an R Project involves having a file with the extension .RProj saved in it. This can be done easily via the options File &gt; New Project from the top RStudio menu.",

In a data frame each column is a variable and each row is a case. They look like spreadsheets containing data.\nThere are several toy data frames built into R, and we can have a look at one to see how it looks like. You can get a list of the available built-in datasets and their brief descriptions with the data() command.\nFor example, the mtcars data frame is built into R and so you can access it without loading any files.

    "text": "User-written packages\nApart from these “recommended” packages, there is a great - and ever increasing - number of user-written packages that satisfy various programming needs. Some packages contain functions that are particularly useful for social scientists. Sometimes a number of packages that contain complementary functionality and are designed to work well together are brought under one meta-package, which allows for all those packages to be installed and loaded at once. The most popular such meta-package is the tidyverse, which includes such packages as dplyr (for data manipulation), readr (for reading in rectangular data like .csv files), tidyr (for cleaning datasets), stringr (for working with “strings”, that is, textual data), forcats (for managing “factors”, that is, categorical variables) or ggplot2 (for data visualisation), among [several others](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/.\nThe tidyverse packages have been developed around a coding philosophy that is very different from that of “base R”. It is sometimes referred to as a special “dialect” of the R language and has greatly contributed to popularising R and making it more easily available to practising social scientists who do not have a programming background, by designing code whose “grammar” is somewhat closer to that of “human” languages such as English. This is generally thought to lower the entry barriers to R for new users, although there isn’t a clear consensus on that.\nAnother recently developed meta-package, which was specifically designed with non-programmer social scientists in mind, is the easystats bundle. We will be relying on easystats packages quite a lot in this module, as they provide a very coherent set of functions that improve on the tidyverse.\nBoth of these meta-packages and thousands of other packages are available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Many more packages are distributed as repositories on code-sharing platforms such as GitHub or R Universe.\nPackages made available on CRAN can be installed using the command install.packages(\"packagename\"). Once the package/library is installed (i.e. it is sitting somewhere on your computer), we can then load functions from that package using the :: operator (e.g. package::function()), or we can make all the functions from a package available by attaching that package with the library() function (e.g. library(package)).\nSo using a package/library is a two-stage process. We:\n\n\n **Install** the package/library onto your computer (from CRAN or another repository)\n2.a. Load functions from the package as you use them, or: 2.b. Attach the whole package to R’s search path, making all functions available to use by name\n\nLet’s start by installing the tidyverse meta-package, and then attach it:\n\nCodeinstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")  ## this command installs packages from CRAN; note the quotation marks around the package name\n\n\nYou can check the suite of packages that are available when you attach the tidyverse library using a command from the tidyverse itself:\n\nCodetidyverse_packages()\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhy do you think we got an error message when we tried to run the above command?\n\nBecause tidyverse_packages() is itself a function from the tidyverse, in order to use that function we need not only to install the tidyverse but also to make its functions available. In other words, we did not yet attach the tidyverse for use in our R session, we only just installed it on our computers.\nIf we don’t want to attach a package that we have downloaded - because maybe we only want to use a single function once and we don’t want to burden our computer’s memory, we can load explicitly given functions from a package in the following way:\n\nCodetidyverse::tidyverse_packages()  # Here we state the package followed by two colons, then followed by the function we want\n\n\nBut in many cases we do want to use several functions at various points in an analysis session, so it is often useful to attach the entire package or set of packages:\n\nCodelibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nNow we can use functions from that package without having to explicitly state the name of the package. We can still state the name explicitly, and that may be useful for readers of our code to understand what package a function come from. Also, it may happen that different packages have similarly named functions, and if all those packages are attached, then the functions from a package attached later will override that in the package attached earlier. R will note in a comment whether any functions from a package are masked by another, so it’s worth paying attention to the comments and warnings printed by R when we attach packages.",

For example, the pacman package contains a function p_load() that allows us to attach several packages at once and install them from CRAN on the fly if they are not yet installed. The sister function p_load_gh() does the same for packages not published on CRAN but stored on personal repositories on GitHub. The librarian package does the same with the shelf() function, which installs missing packages from CRAN as well as GitHub.\nFor example, we can download and attach a number of packages in one go with the command below:\n\nCode# First, install {librarian} itself if not yet installed:\n\nif (!require(\"librarian\")) install.packages(\"librarian\") \n\n# Then attach/install other packages using `librarian::shelf()`:\n\nlibrarian::shelf(\n  tidyverse,\n  easystats,\n  sjlabelled,\n  gtsummary,\n  ggformula\n  )\n\n\nThese are some useful packages that we will be using in this module.

Tibbles are very similar to the data.frames (which are the basic types of object storing datasets in base R) and it is perfectly fine to use Tidyverse functions on a data.frame object. Just be aware that in most cases, the Tidyverse function will transform your data into a tibble. If you are unobservant, you won’t even notice a difference. However, there are a few differences between the two data types, most of which are just designed to make your life easier. For more info, check R4DS.",

Here are some of the most common functions in dplyr:\n\n\nfilter() chooses rows based on column values.\n\narrange() changes the order of the rows.\n\nselect() changes whether or not a column is included.\n\nrename() changes the name of columns.\n\nmutate()/transmute() changes the values of columns and creates new columns (variables)\n\nsummarise() compute statistical summaries (e.g., computing the mean or the sum)\n\ngroup_by() group data into rows with the same values\n\nungroup() remove grouping information from data frame.\n\ndistinct() remove duplicate rows.\n\nAll these functions work similarly as follows:\n\nThe first argument is a data frame/tibble\nThe subsequent arguments are comma separated list of unquoted variable names and the specification of what you want to do\nThe result is a new data frame\n\nFor more info, check R for Social Scientists\nMost of the dplyr verbs perform tasks that can also be done in base R, but they provide more convenience. The table below lists a rough equivalence between dplyr and base R functionality:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\nbase\n\n\n\narrange(df, x)\ndf[order(x), , drop = FALSE]\n\n\ndistinct(df, x)\n\ndf[!duplicated(x), , drop = FALSE], unique()\n\n\n\nfilter(df, x)\n\ndf[which(x), , drop = FALSE], subset()\n\n\n\nmutate(df, z = x + y)\n\ndf$z &lt;- df$x + df$y, transform()\n\n\n\npull(df, 1)\ndf[[1]]\n\n\npull(df, x)\ndf$x\n\n\nrename(df, y = x)\nnames(df)[names(df) == \"x\"] &lt;- \"y\"\n\n\nrelocate(df, y)\ndf[union(\"y\", names(df))]\n\n\nselect(df, x, y)\n\ndf[c(\"x\", \"y\")], subset()\n\n\n\nselect(df, starts_with(\"x\"))\ndf[grepl(\"^x\", names(df))]\n\n\nsummarise(df, mean(x))\n\nmean(df$x), tapply(), aggregate(), by()\n\n\n\nslice(df, c(1, 2, 5))\ndf[c(1, 2, 5), , drop = FALSE]\n\n\n\nThe above functions allow us to manage single data-frames. A set of other functions (sometimes called “two-table verbs”) make it possible to combine columns, rows, or both, from two or more data-frames. In base-R, much of this can be achieved with the merge() function, while in dplyr the join() function makes this possible, extending some further functionality that is not easily available in base-R. The table below lists these dplyr functions and their base-R equivalents:\n\n\ndplyr\nbase\n\n\n\ninner_join(df1, df2)\nmerge(df1, df2)\n\n\nleft_join(df1, df2)\nmerge(df1, df2, all.x = TRUE)\n\n\nright_join(df1, df2)\nmerge(df1, df2, all.y = TRUE)\n\n\nfull_join(df1, df2)\nmerge(df1, df2, all = TRUE)\n\n\nsemi_join(df1, df2)\ndf1[df1$x %in% df2$x, , drop = FALSE]\n\n\nanti_join(df1, df2)\ndf1[!df1$x %in% df2$x, , drop = FALSE]",

    "text": "The forward-pipe (%&gt;%/|&gt;) workflow\nAll of the dplyr functions take a data frame or tibble as the first argument. Rather than forcing the user to either save intermediate objects or nest functions, dplyr provides the forward-pipe operator %&gt;% from the magrittr package. This operator allows us to combine multiple operations into a single sequential chain of actions. As of R 4.1.0 there is also a native pipe operator in R (|&gt;), and in RStudio one can set the shortcut to paste the new pipe operator instead (as we have done at the beginning of the lab). Going forward, we’ll use this version of the pipe operator for simplicity, but it’s likely that you will encounter the older version of the operator too in various scripts.\nLet’s start with a hypothetical example. Say you would like to perform a sequence of operations on data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h():\n\nTake x then\n\nUse x as an input to a function f() then\n\nUse the output of f(x) as an input to a function g() then\n\nUse the output of g(f(x)) as an input to a function h()\n\nOne way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows:\nh(g(f(x)))\nThis code isn’t so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: f(), then g(), then h() and each of the functions is short in its name. Further, each of these functions also only has one argument. However, you can imagine that this will get progressively harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases and the arguments in each function increase as well. This is where the pipe operator |&gt; comes in handy. |&gt; takes the output of one function and then “pipes” it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read |&gt; as “then” or “and then.” For example, you can obtain the same output as the hypothetical sequence of functions as follows:\nx |&gt; \n  f() |&gt; \n  g() |&gt; \n  h()\nYou would read this sequence as:\n\nTake x then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function f() then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function g() then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function h()\n\nSo while both approaches achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can clearly read the sequence of operations line-by-line. Instead of typing out the three strange characters of the operator, one can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + M (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + M (MacOS) to paste the operator.",

This file format allows you to combine both longer written text (such as detailed descriptions of your data analysis process or the main body of a report or journal article) with code chunks. To get you started using this file format, read Chapter 3.2. in TSD. Below we will focus only on the code chunks.\nCompared to what you have done in the R script, in the main Quarto document a # refers to a heading level rather than a comment. If you want to include a code chunk, you can click on the +C tab in the upper-right corner of the .qmd document’s toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+i. In the code chunk you would write in the same way as you did in the R script (they are basically mini-scripts). Within a code-chunk, therefore, the # still refers to a comment.\nTo execute a command withing a code chunk, you can either run each line/selection separately using Ctrl+Enter as in the R script, or you can run the entire content of the chunk with the green right-pointing triangle-arrow in the upper-right corner of the chunk.\nLet’s continue doing some operations on the mtcars dataset we looked at earlier, this time using some useful tidyverse functions.\nLet’s subset the data frame by selecting certain rows or columns. In tidyverse, you can do this with the filter() function for selecting rows and the select() function for selecting columns. Here we pipe the selections into head() to show the first few rows. You could also use the dplyr::slice_head function\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  select(mpg, wt) |&gt;\n  head()\n\nTo select the cars with eight cylinders:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  filter(cyl == 8)\n\nWe can use the slice() function. For example, to get the 5th through 10th rows:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  slice(5:10)\n\nIf we pass a vector of integers to the select function, we will get the variables corresponding to those column positions. So to get the first through third columns:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  select(1:3) |&gt;\n  head()\n\nIf you call summary() a data frame, it produces applies the vector version of the summary command to each column:\n\nsummary(mtcars)\n\nThese few tasks should be enough to get you started with R and RStudio.\nIf this was your first encounter with R, you can complete the R for Social Scientists online training too sometime during the week.\nFrom next week we will begin working actively with real data and address specific data management challenges that arise from there.\nThose of you who have worked on the advanced user exercise can check some optional solutions below.",

The module aims to provide a broad applied introduction to more advanced methods in quantitative analysis for students from various disciplinary backgrounds. See the module plan page for details about the methods covered. The course content consists of eight 1.5-hour lectures and eight 1.5-hour IT labs.\nThe course stands on three pillars:\n\n\nApplication\n\n\nComputation\n\n\nReproducibility\n\n\n\n\nApplication: we will work with real data originating from large-scale representative surveys or published research, with the aim of applying methods to concrete research scenarios. IT lab exercises will involve reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. The aim is to see how methods have been used in practice in various disciplines and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable students to apply this knowledge to their own research questions. The data used in IT labs may be cleansed to allow focusing more on modelling tasks than on data wrangling, but exercises will address some of the more common data manipulation challenges and will cover essential functions. Data cleansing scripts will also be provided so that interested students can use them in their own work.\n\n\n\n\nComputation: the development of computational methods underpins the application of the most important statistical ideas of the past 50 years (see Andrew Gelman’s article on these developments here or an online workshop talk here; Richard McElreath’s great talk on Science as Amateur Software Development is well worth watching too). This module aims to develop basic computational skills that allow the application of complex statistical models to practical scientific problems without advanced mathematical knowledge, and which lay the foundation on which students can then pursue further learning and research in computational humanities and social sciences.\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility: developing a reproducible workflow that allows your future self or a reviewer of your work to understand your process of analysis and reproduce your results is essential for reliable and transparent scientific research. For an overview of why it’s important to develop a reproducible workflow early on in your research career and how to do it using (some) of the tools employed in this module, read Chapter 3 of TSD (see Resources &gt; Readings). In this course, we will be using a suite of well-integrated free and open-source software to aid our reproducible workflow (see Resources &gt; Software).\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nTo benefit the most from this module, students are expected to have a foundational level of knowledge in quantitative methods: a good understanding of data types and distributions, familiarity with inferential statistics, and some exposure to linear regression. This is roughly equivalent to the content covered in a textbook such as OpenIntro Statistics (which you can download for free).\n\n\nNo previous knowledge of  or other command-based statistical analysis software is needed, but if starting from scratch, students are advised to complete the self-paced R for Social Scientists Data Carpentry course outside class and to consult Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund’s ebook R for Data Science.\n\n\n\nCopyright  Chris Moreh, 2025."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis session explores examples of interactions in regression models. We will look more closely at some of the multiple regression models we have fit in previous labs and ask whether the effects of core explanatory variables could be said to depend on (or are conditioned on) the values of other explanatory variables included in the model. In practice, this will involve including the product of two explanatory variables in the model. Thus, taking a regression model of the generic form \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\epsilon\\), we ask whether there is an interaction between variables \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) (i.e. whether the effect of one depends on the values of the other) by fitting a model of the form \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\color{green}{\\beta_3(X_1 \\times X_2)} + \\epsilon\\), where we are interested in the “interaction effect” represented by \\(\\beta_3\\).\nWhile fitting such interaction models is simple in practice, understanding when they are needed, interpreting, and communicating their results can be challenging, and a growing literature in the social sciences has explored best practices in relation to such models (Berry, Golder, and Milton 2012; Brambor, Clark, and Golder 2006; Clark and Golder 2023; Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu 2019). Advancements in software have also made it easier to interpret and present results from interaction models, with some notable R packages entering this space over the past few years; we have already encountered the marginaleffects and ggeffects packages when visualising results from logistic regression models, and examining results from interaction models presents very similar challenges. In this week’s lab we will use some of these tools to undertake comprehensive analyses of interaction effects.\nWe have already encountered interactions in all of the application readings we have engaged with so far. However, they mostly involved more complex cases of interactions, whose understanding will first require a more basic knowledge of how interaction effects work and how they can be implemented in practice. Wu (2021) and Dingemans and Van Ingen (2015) make use of “cross-level” interactions, which we will revisit when learning about multilevel models (Week 6). Mitchell (2021) uses higher-level interactions on data aggregated at country level as an additional analysis to their main models, while Österman (2021) operates with a quasi-experimental design in which the interaction effect is taken to divulge a more directly causal effect the data. This latter example is “more complex” only at a conceptual and study design level, and we will replicate it in the lab exercises. However, we begin by looking at a conceptually less involved example where interaction effects are at the core of the analysis, also from the field of social trust research.",

    "text": "Hierarchical data are ubiquitous in the social and human sciences (and beyond). In fact, almost all the application articles we have engaged with so far in previous labs modelled hierarchical data., and almost all modelled them explicitly as such, applying some multilevel modelling technique. In some cases the hierarchies themselves were of central theoretical importance and played a crucial role in the stated estimand (i.e. “the object of inquiry—(…) the precise quantity about which we marshal data to draw an inference” (see Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart 2021:532). In others, taking into account the hierarchical nature of the data was meant to improve the precision of the main effect estimates. The importance of accounting for hierarchical dependencies in our models is emphasised by no one else more than Richard McElreath, who, in his important introductory-level book to Bayesian statistics, wants “to convince the reader of something that appears unreasonable: multilevel regression deserves to be the default form of regression” (McElreath 2020:15). According to him, “papers that do not use multilevel models should have to justify not using a multilevel approach”. In this session, we will learn how to think about and fit hierarchical models in R, and we’ll discuss some of the challenges of multilevel modelling and the possible justifications not to use them in certain contexts.\n\nReadings\nTextbook\n\nARM: Chapters 11 (pp. 237-249) and 12 (pp. 251-278)\nTSD: Chapter section 15.2\n\nApplication\n\nÖsterman, Marcus. 2021. ‘Can We Trust Education for Fostering Trust?

    "text": "It wasn’t until the last quarter of the 20th century that a unified vision of statistical modelling emerged, allowing practitioners to see how the general linear model we have explored so far is only a specific case of a more general class of models. We could have had a fancy, memorable name for this class of models - as John Nelder, one of its inventors, acknowledged later in life (Senn 2003, 127) - but back then academics were not required to undertake marketing training on the tweetabilty-factor of the chosen names for their theories; so we ended up with “generalised linear models”. These models can be applied to explananda (“explained”, “response”, “outcome”, “dependent” etc. variables, our ys) whose possible values have certain constraints (such as being limited by a lower bound or constrained to discreet choices) that makes the parameters of the Gaussian (‘normal’) distribution inefficient in describing them. Instead, they follow some of the other “exponential distributions” (and not only the exponential: cf. Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020, 264)), of which the Poisson, gamma, beta, binomial and multinomial are probably the most common in human and social sciences research. Their “generalised linear modelling” involves mapping them unto a linear model using a so-called “link function”. We will explore what all of this means in practice and how it can be applied to data that we are interested in most in our respective fields of study.",

    "text": "Description\nIn Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella, the inhabitants of Flatland are geometric shapes living in a two-dimensional world, incapable of imagining the existence of higher dimensions. A sphere passing through the plain of their world is a fascinating but incomprehensible event: Flatlanders can only see a dot becoming a circle, increasing in circumference, then shrinking back in size and disappearing. There are, in this universe, worlds with even more limited views, like the one-dimensional Lineland and the zero-dimensional Pointland. Any attempt to expand the perspective of their inhabitant(s) is doomed to failure. But as in any good adventure story, a chosen Flatland native embarks on a journey of discovery and revelation - and ostracism and imprisonment. The story is interpreted as an allegorical criticism of Victorian-age social structure, but can equally describe the limitations of inhabiting uncritically a methodological world in which all data are ‘normal’ and all relationships are linear. Moving beyond linearity and acquiring the statistical intuition needed to think in higher dimensions and perceive more complex relationships is indeed a matter of practice-induced revelation. It’s unlikely that we will reach statistical nirvana in this short course, but we’ll attempt to build some more substantial structures upon the arid plains of linear regression. We start by looking around in the Flat-, Line- and Point-lands of quantitative analysis. Incorrigible procrastinators may want to check out a full-length computer animated film version of Flatland on YouTube.

    "text": "Description\nThis week we will return to some of the models we fit over the past two weeks and turn our attention to the right-hand side of the regression equations. We will explore interaction effects, which allow for the association between a predictor and an outcome to depend upon the value of another predictor. Understanding interaction effects - and the concept of conditioning more broadly - can help avoid serious misrepresentations and misunderstandings of our data. Some famous statistical “paradoxes” can highlight these dangers, and the lecture will build on these conceptual examples before moving on to questions of model-building. It is technically very simple to fit models with complex interactions, however, their interpretation can be very difficult. As with the logistic regression model we covered in Week 3, we will explore ways to present and visualise results from interaction models, which make their interpretation easier. Exploring interactions also allows us to begin thinking about causality and causal modelling, a topic that we will expand upon in Week 5.\n\n\nReadings\nStatistics\n\nROS: Chapters 10-12\n\nAdvanced statistics readings\n\nBrambor, T., W.

The special kind of multilevel data structure we consider here involves repeated measurements on persons (or other units); measurements are therefore clustered within persons (or other units), and predictors can be available at the measurement or person level. Such datasets are often called panel or longitudinal. In settings where overall time trends are important, repeated measurement data are sometimes called time-series cross-sectional. Time-series cross-sectional data typically contain observations at regular time interval, and they commonly exhibit overall time patterns. In many such contexts one must consider how measurements cluster not only in the “temporal” variable but also in the “spatial” variable (e.g. country-year-level observations clustered within countries as well as years), with the potential for predictors at three levels (individual, temporal and spatial).

    "text": "R as a simple calculator\nThe most elementary yet still handy task you can use  for is to perform basic arithmetic operations. This is useful for getting a first experience doing things in the  language. This is aided by R’s arithmetic operators, which we can find out more about if we type and execute the command help(Arithmetic). Generally, the help() function allows us to access R’s internal helper pages.\nLet’s say we want to know the result of adding up three numbers: 1, 3 and 5:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis will print out the result (9).\nThe [1] in the result is just the line number; in this case, our result only consists of a single line.\nWe can also save the result of this operation as an object, so we can use it in further operations. We create objects by using the so-called assignment operator consisting of the characters &lt;- (resembling a left-arrow).\nA command involving &lt;- can be read as “assign the value of the result from the operation on the right hand side (some expression) to the object on the left hand side (short name of object, single word, with no spaces)”.\nFor example, let’s save our result in an object called “nine”:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice that there is no output printed this time. But there are also no error messages, so the operation must have run without problems. Instead, if you are working in the Console within RStudio, the newly created objects will be listed in the Environment pane; you should have an object called “nine” there that stores the single value “9” in it. We can now use this object for other operations, such as:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can also check results of so-called relational operations. There are several relational operators that allow us to compare objects in R. The most useful of these are the following:\n\n\n&gt; greater than, &gt;= greater than or equal to\n\n&lt; less than, &lt;= less than or equal to\n\n== equal to\n\n!= not equal to\n\nWhen we use these to compare two objects in R, we end up with a logical object.\nFor example, let’s check whether 9 is greater than 5, and whether it is lower than 8:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n treats our inputs as statements that we are asking it to evaluate, and we get the answers “TRUE” and “FALSE”, respectively, as we would expect. Let’s now check whether our object “nine” is equal to the number 9. We may assume that we can achieve this by typing “nine = 9”, but let’s see what that results in:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nDid we get the result we expected? Nothing was printed in the output, so seemingly nothing happened… That’s because the “=” sign is also used as an assignment operator in , just like “&lt;-”. So we basically assigned the value “9” to the object “nine” again. To use the equal sign as a logical operator we must type it twice (==). Let’s see:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow we get the answer “TRUE”, as expected.\nThis distinction between “=” and “==” is important to keep in mind. What would have happened if we had tried to test whether our object “nine” equals value “5” or not, and instead of the logical operator (==) we used the assignment operator (=)? Let’s see:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn the Console we again see no results printed, but if we check our Environment, we see that the value of the object “nine” was changed to 5. So it can be a dangerous business. We’ll be using the “&lt;-” as assignment operator instead of “=” to avoid any confusion in this respect. The distinction between == and = will also emerge in other contexts later.\nSo, try out the following commands in turn now and check if the results are what you’d expect:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe text following the hashtag (#) in the last line is a comment. If you’d like to comment on any code you write just add a hash (#) or series of hashes in front of it so that  knows it should not evaluate it as a command. This will be useful when writing your commands in an R script that you can save for later, rather than interacting with  live in the Console.",

We can examine some of its features:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThese tell us something about the characteristics of the object, but not much about its content (apart from the fact that it has a length of 5). Functions such as min, max, range, mean, median, sum or summary give us some summary statistics about the object:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe seq() function lets us create a sequence from a starting point to an ending point. If you specify the by argument, you can skip values. For instance, if we wanted a vector of every 5th number between 0 and 100, we could write:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo print out the result in the console, we can simply type the name of the object:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nA shorthand version to get a sequence between two numbers counting by 1s is to use the : sign.

You can combine the square bracket subset [] with the assignment operator &lt;- to replace a particular value:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can replace multiple values at the same time by using a vector for subsetting:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf the replacement vector (the right-hand side) is shorter than what you are assigning to (the left-hand side), the values will “recycle” or repeat as necessary:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also create a vector of characters (words, letters, punctuation, etc):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote for vectors, you cannot mix characters and numbers in the same vector. If you add a single character element, the whole vector gets converted.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLogical vectors are just vectors that only contain the special values TRUE or FALSE.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTRUE and FALSE can be shortened to T and F, respectively. However, it is stylistically recommended to spell them out. Also, note that  is case-sensitive, so typing something like true, True or fALSE would give an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to the advanced exercise: leap year functions\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to make sure that we have a definition of a leap year. We can go for this one, from the Royal Museums of Greenwich:\n\nTo be a leap year, the year number must be divisible by four – except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n\nSo, we need to write a function that calculates whether a given number is divisible by another or not. We still need to simplify this further conceptually. If a number is divisible by another, that means that there is no ‘remainder’, or in other words, that the ‘remainder’ is 0. Is there a mathematical operation that could come in handy here? We may remember that the modulo operation gives the remainder when dividing. For example, “5 modulo 3 = 2” because \\({5\\over3}=1\\) with a remainder of \\(2\\).\nKnowing this will be extremely helpful, but we also need to know how the modulo operation is implemented in . We could do a search in  for ?Arithmetic to find a list of arithmetic operators, and we’d find that the operator %% stands for the modulo operation.\nWe now have all the knowledge elements we need to get down to programming a leap-year function in :\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "ReadingsSoftwareTrainingHelp\n\n\n\nStatistics\nThe course does not strictly follow the content of a textbook, but the expectation is that students will read as much as possible of the assigned chapters from the following books:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. 2020. Regression and other stories. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ROS\n\n\nFree to download PDF version from the book’s website: https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexander, Rohan. 2023. Telling Stories with Data. Chapman and Hall/CRC  TSD\n\n\nFree online book: https://tellingstorieswithdata.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, A., and Hill, J. 2007. Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ARM\n\n\nNote: ROS is the expanded and updated version of Part 1 (and some of Part 3) of this book. While everyone in the free world eagerly awaits the publication of ROS’s multilevel counterpart, we’ll use ARM as a reference work for the theory underpinning multilevel modelling.  Not freely available. Access it in print or online via the NU library\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatively large portions of text will be assigned for reading in each week from these books, referring to them by their acronyms. Don’t worry if you cannot read all the textbook content assigned in any given week! Those for whom the method covered by the assigned readings is new, will be able to refer back to them throughout the semester and beyond, reading thoroughly and completing the applied exercises. Those already familiar to some extent with the methods, should nonetheless read the text as a narrative and will discover hidden gems that will spectacularly improve their understanding and ability to interpret their statistical results.\n\n\nCoding\nThere will also be various readings relating more closely to the technicalities of coding in R and scientific writing, collaboration and communication in general. These readings will also be listed under each week’s outline as the semester progresses. The generic reading that students are advised to go through on their own is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund. 2022. R for Data Science (2nd ed.)  R4DS\n\n\nFree online book: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication articles\nIn the IT labs we will practice applying methods by reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. To fully understand the context of these data and the methods used, you must read the original journal articles and the available supplementary materials provided alongside. These readings will be listed under each week’s outline (still work in progress!).\nThe articles come from a variety of different fields, so expect them to push you outside your disciplinary comfort zone. The point is to see how methods have been used in practice and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable you to apply this knowledge to your own research questions.\nWhen selecting the articles, the aim was to strike a fine balance between (a) the simplicity of the methods employed, (b) data and analytical transparency, and (c) the strength of the analysis. So don’t take them as examples of all-rounds best practice, but examples of research that gets published while being self-confident enough to open itself up for public scrutiny. Aim for this in your own research!\n\n\nOther readings\nFinally, there will also be recommended readings listed under certain weeks that help place methods, statistics and probability theory in a broader frame. These are useful readings for everyone, regardless of whether you will be applying quantitative analysis in your research or future work.\n\n\n\n\nRequired software\nWe will use a number of open-source software for data analysis and scientific writing. You need to install these on your personal computers to be able to work away from campus:\n\n\n\n\nR\n(programming language)\nEssential\nR needs to be installed even if we will only use it via the RStudio interface.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nRStudio\n(integrated development environment)\nEssential\nYou will need the free desktop version appropriate for your operating system. RStudio combines the R Console - the direct interface to R - with a number of other panels.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nTidyverse\n(collection of R packages)\nEssential\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages that make the R language easier to use by introducing a more consistent grammar. It provides functions that are particularly useful for data manipulation and visualisation. It is the most common ‘dialect’ used among social scientists.\nInstall from within RStudio by executing in the Console:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\nQuarto\n(scientific publishing system)\nEssential\nWe will be using Quarto markdown documents (.qmd) throughout the course to document our data analysis. .qmd files extend the plain-text Markdown mark-up language (.md) to allow for data analysis code to be executed and results presented alongside the main text. This is an essential requirement for analytical transparency, reliability and reproducibility.The assignment will also be completed in .qmd.\nIncluded by default in the latest RStudio release; no need to install separately.\nYou can check your installation by executing in the RStudio Terminal :\nquarto check\n\n\n\nZotero\n(reference manager)\nRecommended\nIf you are not yet using a reference manager, I recommend giving Zotero a try. It will make your work much more efficient and it integrates (relatively well) with RMarkdown and Quarto using the the Better BibTeX add-on.\nInstall the latest version and add-ons from here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with no previous experience using R and/or RStudio are advised to complete the self-paced free online training course R for Social Scientists provided by Data Carpentry at https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/:\n\n\nThere are several Data Carpentry workshops run physically at Newcastle and these sessions can be booked at https://nclrse-training.github.io/Workshop-Webpage-Under-Construction/:\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to get help with  outside class. If you encounter an error message or are looking for a function to perform a specific task that we have not covered in class, you can do a Google search; for best results, use the https://rseek.org/ search engine, which limits the results to those relating to the  language.\nYou can also search for answers on Stack Overflow, which is a popular help and discussion website for programmers. You can also post a question there, but make sure to follow community standards and advice on how to ask a good question and how to provide a minimal reproducible example. You will need some experience using the site before being able to ask a good question, but it’s more than certain that any question you have at this stage has already been asked and answered somewhere. Make sure you do a comprehensive search with various prompts before thinking about asking your question.\nIncreasingly, large language model-based chatbots such as the (in)famous ChatGPT can also provide good answers. You can use them efficiently, but make sure to always test out the responses, in the overwhelming majority of the cases the advice they give is unreliable, at least at first try."

    "text": "The RStudio interface\nThe RStudio interface consists of four main panes (which can be customised to some degree):\n\nThe R Console Pane\nThe R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R engine. This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. The Console is the direct interface to the R software itself; it’s what we get if instead of RStudio we open the R software: a direct interface to the R programming language, where we can type commands and where results/messages are printed.\nYou can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script. For this reason, we should not use the Console pane directly too much, ad reserve it only for quick and dirty calculations and checks. For typing commands that we want R to execute, we should instead use an R script file, where everything we type can be saved for later and complex analyses can be built up.\nThe Source Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-left, is a space to work with scripts and other text files. This pane is also where datasets (data frames) open up for viewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your RStudio displays only one pane on the left, it is because you have no scripts open yet. We can open an existing one or create a new one. We’ll do that a bit later.\n\n\n\nThe Environment Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of objects that are available in an active session. Datasets loaded for analysis would appear here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your Environment is empty, it means that you don’t have any objects loaded or created yet. We will be creating some objects later and we will also import an example dataset.\n\n\n\nFiles, Plots, Packages, Help, etc. The lower-right pane includes several tabs including plots (display of graphics including maps), help, a file library, and available R packages (including installation/update options).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nYou can arrange the panes in various ways, depending on your preferences, using Tools &gt; Global Options in the top menu. So the arrangement of panes may look different on different computers."

Make sure these are un-ticked and set to Never, respectively, as shown in the picture. It’s always safer to start each RStudio session in a clean state, without anything automatically pre-loaded from a previous session. That could lead to serious and hard to trace complications.\nIn the picture on the right, you have the option to select that the new native pipe operator (|&gt;) (we’ll talk about it later!) be inserted using the Ctrl+Shift+M keyboard shortcut instead of the older version of the pipe (%&gt;%).\n\nThese settings will make more sense later, but it’s a good idea to have them sorted at the very beginning."

    "text": "Scripts, markdown documents and projects\nWriting brief commands that you want to test out in the Console is okay, but what you really want is to save your commands as part of a workflow in a dedicated file that you can reuse, extend and share with others.\nIn every quantitative analysis, we need to ensure that each step in our analysis is traceable and reproducible. This is increasingly a professional standard expected of all data analysts in the social sciences. This means that we need to have an efficient way in which to share our analysis code, as well as our outputs and interpretations of our findings. RStudio has an efficient way of handling this requirement with the use of R script files and versions of the Markdown markup language that allow the efficient combining of plain text (as in the main body of an article) with analysis code and outputs produced in R. The table below lists the main characteristics of these file types:\n\n\nFormat\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\nR Script\n.R\nUse an R script if you want to document a large amount of code used for a particular analysis project. Scripts should contain working R commands and human-readable comments explaining the code. Commands can be run line-by-line, or the whole R script can be run at once. For example, one can write an R script containing a few hundred or thousands of lines of code that gathers and prepares raw, unruly data for analysis; if this script can run without any errors, then it can be saved and sourced from within another script that contains code that undertakes the analysis using the cleansed dataset. Comments can be added by appending them with a hashtag (#).\n\n\nR Markdown\n.Rmd\n\nMarkdown is a simple markup language that allows the formatting of plain text documents. R Markdown is a version of this language written by the R Studio team, which also allows for R code to be included. Plain text documents having the .Rmd extension and containing R Markdown-specific code can be knitted (exported) directly into published output document formats such as HTML, PDF or Microsoft Word, which contain both normal text as well as tables and charts produced with the embedded R code. The code itself can also be printed to the output documents.\n\n\nQuarto document\n.qmd\nQuarto is a newer version of R Markdown which allows better compatibility with other programming languages. It is a broader ecosystem design for academic publishing and communication (for example, the course website was built using quarto), but you will be using only Quarto documents in this module. There isn’t much difference between .Rmd and .qmd documents for their uses-cases on this module, so one could easily change and .Rmd extension to .qmd and still produce the same output. .qmd documents are rendered instead of knitted, but for RStudio users the underlying engine doing the conversion from Quarto/R Markdown to standard Markdown to output file (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) is the same. Read more about Quarto document in the TSD textbook.\n\n\n\nCreating new files can be done easily via the options File &gt; New File &gt; from the top RStudio menu.\nThe best way to use these files are as part of R project folders, which allow for cross-references to documents and datasets to be made relative to the path of the project folder root. This makes sure that no absolute paths to files (i.e. things like C:/Documents/Chris/my_article/data_files/my_dataset.rds) need to be used (instead, you would write something like ~/data_files/my_dataset.rds if the my_article folder was set up as an R Project). This allows for the same code file to be run on another computer too without an error, ensuring a minimal expected level of reproducibility in your workflow.\nSetting up an existing or a new folder as an R Project involves having a file with the extension .RProj saved in it. This can be done easily via the options File &gt; New Project from the top RStudio menu."

You can get a list of the available built-in datasets and their brief descriptions with the data() command.\nFor example, the mtcars data frame is built into R and so you can access it without loading any files.

    "section": "Packages",
    "text": "Packages\nInstead of programming your own functions in the R language, you can rely on functions written by other people and bundled within a package that performs some set task.\nWhen you install R, a set of packages containing various functions are also installed by default. These packages make up what is colloquially referred to as base R. Functions from these packages can be used straight away and they cannot be deleted or installed separately. The functionality of these base R packages is updated with each new edition of R, but not in between new releases of the software. The code below lists the names of all the packages in base R:\n\n\nnames(which(installed.packages()[ ,\"Priority\"] == \"base\", ))\n\n\n [1] \"base\"      \"compiler\"  \"datasets\"  \"graphics\"  \"grDevices\" \"grid\"     \n [7] \"methods\"   \"parallel\"  \"splines\"   \"stats\"     \"stats4\"    \"tcltk\"    \n[13] \"tools\"     \"utils\"    \n\n\nWe see in the list that there is also a package called base, which contains 1283 elementary functions. However, when we refer to base R, we usually mean the functions from all the 14 packages listed above.\nApart from these packages that come pre-installed and pre-loaded with our R installation, there are also a number of recommended packages, which can be thought of as an extended base R. These packages also come pre-installed in binary distributions of R, but they need to be loaded in order to make their functions available for use. These recommended packages are:\n\n\nnames(which(installed.packages()[ ,\"Priority\"] == \"recommended\", ))\n\n\n [1] \"lattice\"    \"MASS\"       \"Matrix\"     \"mgcv\"       \"nlme\"      \n [6] \"boot\"       \"class\"      \"cluster\"    \"codetools\"  \"foreign\"   \n[11] \"KernSmooth\" \"lattice\"    \"MASS\"       \"Matrix\"     \"mgcv\"      \n[16] \"nlme\"       \"nnet\"       \"rpart\"      \"spatial\"    \"survival\"  \n\n\nApart from these recommended packages, there is a great - and ever increasing - number of user-written packages that satisfy various programming needs. Some packages contain functions that are particularly useful for social scientists. Sometimes a number of packages that contain complementary functionality and are designed to work well together are brought under one meta-package, which allows for all those packages to be installed and loaded at once. The most popular such meta-package is the tidyverse, which includes such packages as dplyr (for data manipulation), readr (for reading in rectangular data like .csv files), tidyr (for cleaning datasets), stringr (for working with strings, that is, textual data), forcats (for managing factors, that is, categorical variables) or ggplot2 (for data visualisation), among [several others](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/.\nThe tidyverse packages have been developed around a coding philosophy that is very different from that of base R. It is sometimes referred to as a special dialect of the R language and has greatly contributed to popularising R and making it more easily available to practising social scientists who do not have a programming background, by designing code whose grammar is somewhat closer to that of human languages such as English. This is generally thought to lower the entry barriers to R for new users, although there isn’t a clear consensus on that.\nAnother recently developed meta-package, which was specifically designed with non-programmer social scientists in mind, is the easystats bundle. We will be relying on easystats packages quite a lot in this module, as they provide a very coherent set of functions that improve on the tidyverse.\nBoth of these meta-packages and thousands of other packages are available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Many more packages are distributed as repositories on code-sharing platforms such as GitHub or R Universe.\nPackages made available on CRAN can be installed using the command install.packages(\"packagename\"). Once the package/library is installed (i.e. it is sitting somewhere on your computer), we can then load functions from that package using the :: operator (e.g. package::function()), or we can make all the functions from a package available by attaching that package with the library() function (e.g. library(package)).\nSo using a package/library is a two-stage process. We:\n\n\n **Install** the package/library onto your computer (from CRAN or another repository)\n2.a. Load functions from the package as you use them, or: 2.b. Attach the whole package to R’s search path, making all functions available to use by name\n\nLet’s start by installing the tidyverse meta-package, and then attach it:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")  ## this command installs packages from CRAN; note the quotation marks around the package name\n\n\n\nYou can check the suite of packages that are available when you attach the tidyverse library using a command from the tidyverse itself:\n\n\ntidyverse_packages()\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhy do you think we got an error message when we tried to run the above command?\n\nBecause tidyverse_packages() is itself a function from the tidyverse, in order to use that function we need not only to install the tidyverse but also to make its functions available. In other words, we did not yet attach the tidyverse for use in our R session, we only just installed it on our computers.\nIf we don’t want to attach a package that we have downloaded - because maybe we only want to use a single function once and we don’t want to burden our computer’s memory, we can load explicitly given functions from a package in the following way:\n\n\ntidyverse::tidyverse_packages()  # Here we state the package followed by two colons, then followed by the function we want\n\n\n\nBut in many cases we do want to use several functions at various points in an analysis session, so it is often useful to attach the entire package or set of packages:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\nNow we can use functions from that package without having to explicitly state the name of the package. We can still state the name explicitly, and that may be useful for readers of our code to understand what package a function come from. Also, it may happen that different packages have similarly named functions, and if all those packages are attached, then the functions from a package attached later will override that in the package attached earlier. R will note in a comment whether any functions from a package are masked by another, so it’s worth paying attention to the comments and warnings printed by R when we attach packages."

For example, the pacman package contains a function p_load() that allows us to attach several packages at once and install them from CRAN on the fly if they are not yet installed. The sister function p_load_gh() does the same for packages not published on CRAN but stored on personal repositories on GitHub. The librarian package does the same with the shelf() function, which installs missing packages from CRAN as well as GitHub.\nFor example, we can download and attach a number of packages in one go with the command below:\n\n\n# First, install {librarian} itself if not yet installed:\n\nif (!require(\"librarian\")) install.packages(\"librarian\") \n\n# Then attach/install other packages using `librarian::shelf()`:\n\nlibrarian::shelf(\n  tidyverse,\n  easystats,\n  sjlabelled,\n  gtsummary,\n  ggformula\n  )\n\n\n\nThese are some useful packages that we will be using in this module.

Tibbles are very similar to the data.frames (which are the basic types of object storing datasets in base R) and it is perfectly fine to use Tidyverse functions on a data.frame object. Just be aware that in most cases, the Tidyverse function will transform your data into a tibble. If you are unobservant, you won’t even notice a difference. However, there are a few differences between the two data types, most of which are just designed to make your life easier. For more info, check R4DS."

Here are some of the most common functions in dplyr:\n\n\nfilter() chooses rows based on column values.\n\narrange() changes the order of the rows.\n\nselect() changes whether or not a column is included.\n\nrename() changes the name of columns.\n\nmutate()/transmute() changes the values of columns and creates new columns (variables)\n\nsummarise() compute statistical summaries (e.g., computing the mean or the sum)\n\ngroup_by() group data into rows with the same values\n\nungroup() remove grouping information from data frame.\n\ndistinct() remove duplicate rows.\n\nAll these functions work similarly as follows:\n\nThe first argument is a data frame/tibble\nThe subsequent arguments are comma separated list of unquoted variable names and the specification of what you want to do\nThe result is a new data frame\n\nFor more info, check R for Social Scientists\nMost of the dplyr verbs perform tasks that can also be done in base R, but they provide more convenience. The table below lists a rough equivalence between dplyr and base R functionality:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\nbase\n\n\n\narrange(df, x)\ndf[order(x), , drop = FALSE]\n\n\ndistinct(df, x)\n\ndf[!duplicated(x), , drop = FALSE], unique()\n\n\n\nfilter(df, x)\n\ndf[which(x), , drop = FALSE], subset()\n\n\n\nmutate(df, z = x + y)\n\ndf$z &lt;- df$x + df$y, transform()\n\n\n\npull(df, 1)\ndf[[1]]\n\n\npull(df, x)\ndf$x\n\n\nrename(df, y = x)\nnames(df)[names(df) == \"x\"] &lt;- \"y\"\n\n\nrelocate(df, y)\ndf[union(\"y\", names(df))]\n\n\nselect(df, x, y)\n\ndf[c(\"x\", \"y\")], subset()\n\n\n\nselect(df, starts_with(\"x\"))\ndf[grepl(\"^x\", names(df))]\n\n\nsummarise(df, mean(x))\n\nmean(df$x), tapply(), aggregate(), by()\n\n\n\nslice(df, c(1, 2, 5))\ndf[c(1, 2, 5), , drop = FALSE]\n\n\n\nThe above functions allow us to manage single data-frames. A set of other functions (sometimes called two-table verbs) make it possible to combine columns, rows, or both, from two or more data-frames. In base-R, much of this can be achieved with the merge() function, while in dplyr the join() function makes this possible, extending some further functionality that is not easily available in base-R. The table below lists these dplyr functions and their base-R equivalents:\n\n\ndplyr\nbase\n\n\n\ninner_join(df1, df2)\nmerge(df1, df2)\n\n\nleft_join(df1, df2)\nmerge(df1, df2, all.x = TRUE)\n\n\nright_join(df1, df2)\nmerge(df1, df2, all.y = TRUE)\n\n\nfull_join(df1, df2)\nmerge(df1, df2, all = TRUE)\n\n\nsemi_join(df1, df2)\ndf1[df1$x %in% df2$x, , drop = FALSE]\n\n\nanti_join(df1, df2)\ndf1[!df1$x %in% df2$x, , drop = FALSE]"

    "text": "The forward-pipe (%&gt;%/|&gt;) workflow\nAll of the dplyr functions take a data frame or tibble as the first argument. Rather than forcing the user to either save intermediate objects or nest functions, dplyr provides the forward-pipe operator %&gt;% from the magrittr package. This operator allows us to combine multiple operations into a single sequential chain of actions. As of R 4.1.0 there is also a native pipe operator in R (|&gt;), and in RStudio one can set the shortcut to paste the new pipe operator instead (as we have done at the beginning of the lab). Going forward, we’ll use this version of the pipe operator for simplicity, but it’s likely that you will encounter the older version of the operator too in various scripts.\nLet’s start with a hypothetical example. Say you would like to perform a sequence of operations on data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h():\n\nTake x then\n\nUse x as an input to a function f() then\n\nUse the output of f(x) as an input to a function g() then\n\nUse the output of g(f(x)) as an input to a function h()\n\nOne way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows:\nh(g(f(x)))\nThis code isn’t so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: f(), then g(), then h() and each of the functions is short in its name. Further, each of these functions also only has one argument. However, you can imagine that this will get progressively harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases and the arguments in each function increase as well. This is where the pipe operator |&gt; comes in handy. |&gt; takes the output of one function and then pipes it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read |&gt; as then or and then. For example, you can obtain the same output as the hypothetical sequence of functions as follows:\nx |&gt; \n  f() |&gt; \n  g() |&gt; \n  h()\nYou would read this sequence as:\n\nTake x then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function f() then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function g() then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function h()\n\nSo while both approaches achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can clearly read the sequence of operations line-by-line. Instead of typing out the three strange characters of the operator, one can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + M (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + M (MacOS) to paste the operator."

    "text": "Recoding variables\nThere are a few final alterations that need to be made to the variables:\n\n\ntrust will serve as our response (dependent) variable - the one we want to explain/model. We can see from the codebook that it has two valid categories (“1” and “2”), referring to “Most people can be trusted” and “Need to be very careful”, respectively. Given that it is a binary (dichotomous) variable, we will use binary logistic regression to model it. When we enter a variable into a logistic regression model as dependent variable in R, the first category/level will be automatically recoded internally to the value “0” and be used as the reference category; the latter category/level will be recoded to “1”, and it will be the indicator category that the model predicts in contrast to the reference category. In our case, that will mean that the category referring to “Need to be very careful” will be treated as the indicator variable by default, so effectively the coefficients of the explanatory (predictor, independent) variables will be estimating the propensity towards “distrust”. If we first reversed the order of the categories in the dependent variable, the output would be estimating “trust”, which is conceptually cleaner and more straightforward to interpret;\nFollowing Wu (2021), we can treat our main explanatory variable - education (Highest educational level attained) - as numeric. But in the dataset it is coded as factor, so we will have to either change it to numeric in the dataset, or force it to be treated as numeric by R when fitting the model. Technically, education is categorical in nature, but given that the categories are ordinal in their substantive meaning (increasing from no/less education to more) and there are more than just a handful of levels/categories (there are 9), we can technically treat it as a short numeric scale, while keeping in mind that descriptive statistics such as the mean do not make much sense in this case;\n\nWu (2021) also noted that in some models (including in Model 1, Appendix A. Table 2) they use a recoded categorical version of the education, collapsed over 4 categories: “Primary”, “Secondary”, “Post-secondary”, and “Tertiary” education. We can also create this variable to potentially include it in our models.\n\nWe can make the required transformations in a single call to the datawizard function data_modify() like so:\n\nwvs56 &lt;- wvs56 |&gt;                                                                         # (1)\n  data_modify(trusting = recode_values(trust,\n                                       recode = list(\"0\" = 2)),                           # (2)\n              educ_num = as_numeric(education),                                           # (3)\n              educ_cat_1 = recode_values(education,                                       # (4)\n                                         recode = list(\"1\" = (\"1, 2, 3\"), \n                                                       \"2\" = (\"4, 5, 6, 7\"), \n                                                       \"3\" = (\"8\"),\n                                                       \"4\" = (\"9\"))),                     # (4.1)\n              educ_cat_2 = recode_values(education,                                       # (5)\n                                         recode = list(\"1\" = (\"1, 2\"),\n                                                       \"2\" = (\"3\"), \n                                                       \"3\" = (\"4, 5\"), \n                                                       \"4\" = (\"6, 7\"),\n                                                       \"5\" = (\"8\"),\n                                                       \"6\" = (\"9\")))\n              ) |&gt;                                                                        # (6)\n  set_labels(trusting, labels = c(\"Not trusting\", \"Trusting\")) |&gt;                         # (7)\n  set_labels(educ_cat_1, labels = c(\"Primary\", \n                                    \"Secondary\", \n                                    \"Post-secondary\", \n                                    \"Tertiary\")) |&gt; \n  set_labels(educ_cat_2, labels = c(\"Less than primary\", \n                                    \"Primary\", \n                                    \"Secondary-vocational\", \n                                    \"Secondary-preparatory\", \n                                    \"Post-secondary\", \n                                    \"Tertiary\"))\n  \n# Code explanation:\n# (1) overwrite the data object with the changes\n# (2) reverse the category order of \"trust\" and save it as a new variable called \"trusting\" to make the indicator meaning clearer\n# (3) change the type of variable \"education\" to numeric and save it as the new variable \"educ_num\"\n# (4) recode the \"education\" variable into 4 larger categories and save the new variable as \"educ_cat_1\"\n# (4.1) make sure to close all the brackets under `recode_values()`\n# (5) alternative recode of \"education\" into 6 categories as \"educ_cat_2\"\n# (6) remember to close the brackets under `data_modify()`\n# (7) add value labels\n\nOf course, we could do all the changes one-by-one, but because we can achieve everything we wanted using the data_modify() option, it’s easier to do it all at once. When you are experimenting with recoding, it is probably a good idea to do it one-by-one and check the results at each step to catch out any errors more easily.\nLet’s have a look at the recoded dataset; because we did not overwrite any of the original variables, we will have both the old and the newly recoded/renamed variable in the dataset:\n\nwvs56_codebook &lt;- data_codebook(wvs56)\n\n\nView(wvs56_codebook)\n\nThe newly created variables look like this:\n\n# Showing values:\ndata_tabulate(wvs56, trusting:educ_cat_2)\n\n# Showing value labels:\nwvs56 |&gt; data_select(trusting:educ_cat_2) |&gt; labels_to_levels() |&gt; data_tabulate()",

    "text": "Describing the relationship between the main variables of interest\nNow that the data has been recoded, we can have a closer look at the relationship between our two main variables: trusting and educ_num. Since the education variable is now recorded as numeric, we can make use of a boxplot for visualisation. In Week 2 we practiced building ggplot2 plots incrementally, and the boxplot could be coded like this:\n\nggplot(wvs56) +\n  aes(trusting, educ_num) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nWe could also set the value labels as the values to plot, and we could remove the missing values:\n\nwvs56 |&gt; \n  labels_to_levels(trusting) |&gt; \n  remove_missing() |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n    aes(trusting, educ_num) +\n    geom_boxplot()\n\nWhile ggplot2::ggplot() is flexible and useful for expanding the plots and adding various embellishments, the ggformula package simplifies its syntax by making it similar to the formula syntax used in common modelling functions (such as lm()). All the ggformula commands begin with gf_ followed by the type of the plot. The command for a boxplot would be as simple as:\n\ngf_boxplot(educ_num ~ trusting, data = wvs56)\n\nIt also complies with pipe workflows, like for example:\n\nwvs56 |&gt; \n  labels_to_levels(trusting) |&gt; \n  remove_missing() |&gt; \n  gf_boxplot(educ_num ~ trusting)\n\nLooking at the boxplots, we can see a slightly higher median education level among those in the “Trusting” category (those who responded that “Most people can be trusted” in the survey). For a more detailed numerical summary of this association, we can use another function from the datawizard package, means_by_group():\n\nwvs56 |&gt; means_by_group(\"educ_num\", \"trusting\")\n\nHere we can see more clearly the difference in average education levels between those with high trust levels and those with low trust levels. This table is equivalent to the results from a linear regression model in which the numeric variable educ_num is the dependent variable and trusting is the explanatory (independent) variable. We should keep in mind, however, that while our educ_num variable is treated as numeric, it is in fact an ordinal categorical variable, and a mean value of 5.88 over trusting cannot be interpreted meaningfully. If we are interested in only in differences, we can calculate the median educ_num - and any other statistics - over trusting manually:\n\nwvs56 |&gt; \n  labels_to_levels(trusting) |&gt; \n  remove_missing() |&gt; \n  data_group(trusting) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean_educ = mean(educ_num),\n            median_educ = median(educ_num))\n\nOut interest, however, is in modelling the trusting variable as a function of education, while also accounting for the other demographic covariates. For this, we turn to a logistic regression model.",

    "section": "Simple bivariate logistic regression model",
    "text": "Simple bivariate logistic regression model\nFitting a logistic regression model in R is fairly straightforward. We can use the base R glm() function and would write the following code:\n\nmodel_1 &lt;- glm(trusting ~ educ_num, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"), data = wvs56)\n\nIn the code above, instead of the linear model function (lm()) we used the generalised linear model function (glm()), and because glm() is a larger family of models, we need to also specify which “family” we are fitting; since our dependent variable is binary variable, we are calling the “binomial” family. We also need to specify a “link function” to be used, but the “logit” is the default link for the binomial distribution family, so we could have ommitted it and simply written glm(..., family = binomial).\nIn all other aspects the formula is the same as the one we already know from linear regression.\nLet’s look at the model parameters:\n\nmodel_parameters(model_1)\n\nIt is at the stage of interpretation that logistic regression models become difficult. The coefficients that we obtain in the standard output are similar to those from a linear regression in that they summarise a linear and additive relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The difference is that the dependent variable has been transformed to a logit or logged odds scale. We could say - following the logic of linear regression - that each unit difference in one’s education level is associated with a 0.18-point positive difference in the logged odds/logit value of trusting. But this doesn’t make much sense, because the logit scale is difficult to comprehend.\nIt would be more intuitive to see the results on a different scale. A simple and commonly used transformation is from log-odds to odds ratios. If we exponentiate the logistic regression log-odds coefficients, we could say that the independent variables relate to the odds of the dependent variable, rather than the logged odds, which is somewhat easier to relate to. The model_parameters() function can do that for us in exchange of some additional specification:\n\nmodel_parameters(model_1, exponentiate = TRUE)\n\nThe odds ratios that we find in this table are somewhat easier to interpret, but we need to understand how odds work. By having exponentiated the coefficients, we have moved from an additive scale to a multiplicative scale. Basically, what this means is that while on an additive scale the value “0” means no change (because by adding 0 to a number we do not alter that number), on a multiplicative scale that role is taken over by “1” (when we multiply a number by “1”, we keep it as it is). Consequently, a coefficient of “1” on the exponentiated scale means no difference, while values between 0 and 1 represent a negative difference and values greater than 1 a positive difference.\nI our case, the OR of 1.10 means that a difference of one degree in education level is associated with a positive difference of 1.10 in the odds of being a trusting person. We could further translate this into a percentage: if we subtract 1 from the exponentiated coefficient and multiply it by 100, we get the percentage difference due to a unit change in the independent variable.\n\\[\n\\% \\Delta _{odds} = 100\\times(OR-1)\n\\]\nFor values grater than 1 this calculation is straightforward. In our case, this translates to a 10% increase in the odds of being a trusting person.\nIt doesn’t add much to our understanding to plot the regression results from a model with a single predictor, but knowing how to plot results will be particularly useful once we expand the model with further explanatory variables. To create a plot of the results, we can simply take the output from the model_parameters() function and pass it on to the plot() function included in easystats:\n\nparameters(model_1, exponentiate = TRUE) |&gt; plot()\n\nHowever, the fact that the exponentiated coefficients are measured on a multiplicative scale poses some difficulties and it makes it easy to fall into the trap of interpreting these odds as probabilities.\nThe issue is that odds can range from 0 to infinity, so the scale is far from standard. Probabilities, on the other hand, have the nice feature of being constrained between 0 and 1, so a percentage change has much more meaning.\nThere are several packages that help us compute various comparative statistics on the probability scale from logistic models.\nBelow, we will use the avg_slopes() function from the marginaleffects package to compute the average difference in the probability of being trusting based on a one-unit difference in education level:\n\navg_slopes(model_1)\n\nThe result indicates the change in the predicted probability that the outcome (trusting) equals 1. On average, a unit-change in educ_num changes the predicted probability that the outcome equals 1 by 1.8%.\nThis “average marginal” effect represents the average slope of the predictor, and as such it can be considered as an “adjusted regression coefficient”. However, because the effect is no longer fixed across the values of the predictor variable, it is still less intuitive to talk about an “average” effect in the case of logistic regression.\nTo make these numerical results easier to visualise, we can plot the result.There are several options, but probably the most straightforward approach is to estimate the probabilities of being trusting at each level of the predictor variable (educ_num), then plot the results. The plot_predictions() function from the marginaleffects package or the plot() function of ggeffects can be used here. Below, we’ll use the latter:\n\nggpredict(model_1, \"educ_num\") |&gt; \n  plot()\n\nThis code first calculates predictions of the outcome probability for each level of the explanatory variable using the ggpredict() function (we could save these results as a data-frame), then passes those results on to the plot() function. To remove the overlapping value labels on the horizontal axis, we could add something like the following to the command:\n\nggpredict(model_1, \"educ_num\") |&gt; \n  plot() +\n    scale_x_continuous()\n\nThis graph makes it a lot clearer how education is associated with trust in our model, and if education is our main variable of interest, we can plot its effect even from a larger model that contains other covariates.",

    "text": "Example 1. Akaeda (2023): Are preferences for redistribution associated with education in European countries, and is the association moderated by social trust?\n\nThe research question in the title of this exercise relates directly to the research reported by Akaeda (2023). Following a detailed review of the literature on the relationship between attitudes towards redistribution, education, and social- and institutional trust, the author derives a hypothesis they want to investigate: “trust decreases the gap in preferences for redistribution due to education” (p. 296). They break down the hypothesis into two parts, one relating to social trust and the other to institutional trust.\nAkaeda (2023) combine data from several waves of the World Values Survey (WVS) and the European Values Study (EVS) to test this research hypothesis. Their combined dataset contains data on “74 countries, 26 years, 259 country-years, and 254,214 individuals”. Their interest is in modelling the hypothesised relationship on a global level, accounting both for various individual explanatory variables as well as macro-societal factors at the level of countries and country-years (i.e. change over time within countries).\nHere we will attempt to fit a simpler version of their “Model 3” (reported in Table 2). In terms of data, we focus specifically on “European” countries; for this purpose, we will use data from the latest wave of the European Values Study survey. In terms of variable selection and transformations, we will roughly follow Akaeda (2023), with some adjustments for convenience. Akaeda (2023:297–98) describe their variable selection procedure in these words:\n\n\nthe dependent variable is the score of preferences for redistribution. This score is based on a question … that asks respondents to indicate on a scale from 1 to 10 whether ‘Incomes should be made more equal (1)’ or ‘We need larger income differences as incentives for individual effort (10)’. In accordance with previous research, the scores were reversed such that a higher score indicates stronger support for redistribution;\nthe level of education is a key independent variable because the association between education and support for redistribution is a main focus of this study. Because previous studies have shed light on the mechanisms of university education related to a conservative view of redistribution, this analysis adopts the dummy for university or higher degree as an independent variable;\nas a key moderator variable … social trust as measured by the question, ‘Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?’, which had the following two potential responses: ‘1. Most people can be trusted’, ‘2. Need to be very careful’. Based on previous research involving social trust, this analysis employs the dummy for social trust (1 = ‘Most people can be trusted’);\nthe following individual-level controls: gender (1 = female, 0= male), age, age squared, employment status (employed, self-employed, unemployed, retired, other), household income (z scored for country-year units, marital status (married = 1), child (having child = 1), and political orientation (1 = right to 10 = left)\n\n\nData preparation\nThe original data is freely accessible from the European Values Study website in various formats. For the purposes of this lab, we can also access a lightly edited dataset in native .Rds format from the Data page (evs2017.rds). We can either download the dataset to a local data folder and load it from there, or loaded directly from the web:\n\nevs &lt;- datawizard::data_read(\"https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005/data/evs2017.rds\")\n\nOnce the data is loaded in the workspace environment, we can select the variables that we are interested in, inspect them in a codebook and apply any necessary transformations:\n\n# Select the variables needed:\n\nevs &lt;- evs |&gt; \n  select(v106,      # redistribution pref.\n         v243_r,    # education\n         v31,       # social trust\n         v225,      # sex/gender\n         age,\n         v244,      # employment status\n         v261_ppp,  # household income (corrected)\n         v234,      # marital status\n         v239_r,    # number of children\n         v102,      # political orientation (1=left...10=right)\n         )\n\nView the codebook for the selected variables:\n\ndata_codebook(evs) |&gt; View()\n\nRecode variables to match Akaeda (2023) as closely as possible:\n\nakaeda &lt;- evs |&gt; \n  data_modify(redistribute = reverse(v106),\n              # recode education to a binary; \n              # treat the original variable as a numeric variable in the process to allow referring to numeric codes rather than the long text labels\n              educ_univ = recode_values(as_numeric(v243_r),\n                                   recode = list(`1` = 3,\n                                                 `0` = c(1, 2, 66))),\n              # inverse to make \"most people can be trusted\" the second (indicator) category\n              trusting = recode_values(as_numeric(v31),\n                                       recode = list(`1` = 1,\n                                                     `0` = 2)),\n              # just rename as \"female\" is already the second category\n              female = v225,\n              # recode \"employment\" as a factor/categorical (without treating it as numeric and adding labels later)\n              employment = recode_values(v244,\n                                         recode = list(\"Employed\" = c(\"30h a week or more\", \n                                                                      \"less then 30h a week\"), \n                                                       \"Self-employed\" = \"self employed\", \n                                                       \"Unemployed\" = \"unemployed\", \n                                                       \"Retired\" = \"retired/pensioned\", \n                                                       \"Other\" = c(\"military service\", \n                                                                   \"homemaker not otherwise employed\", \n                                                                   \"student\", \n                                                                   \"disabled\", \n                                                                   \"other\"))),\n              hh_income = v261_ppp,\n              # recoding marital status as numeric\n              married = recode_values(as_numeric(v234),\n                                      recode = list(\"1\" = 1,\n                                                    \"0\" = 2:6)),\n              \n              child = recode_values(v239_r,\n                                    recode = list(\"0\" = 1,\n                                                  \"1\" = 2:6)),\n              politics = reverse(v102)\n              ) |&gt; \n  set_labels(married, labels = c(\"Not married\", \"Maried\")) |&gt; \n  set_labels(trusting, labels = c(\"Not trusting\", \"Trusting\")) |&gt; \n  set_labels(educ_univ, labels = c(\"No university education\", \"University education\")) |&gt; \n  set_labels(child, labels = c(\"No children\", \"Has children\")) |&gt; \n  # Treat them as factors again for better reporting of labels\n  to_label(married, trusting, educ_univ, child, married)\n\nView the codebook for the recoded dataset:\n\ndata_codebook(akaeda) |&gt; View()\n\nRelationships between the main variables of interest\nFollowing Akaeda (2023), the main variables of interest are redistribute, educ_univ and trusting.

With :, we include in the regression model only the interaction term, but not the component variables (i.e. their main effects); to include the component variables as well, we need to add them in as usual with the + operator. To note that we should normally want to include both main effects and and the interaction effects in a regression model. With *, we include both the main effects and the interaction effects, so it provides a shortcut to using :, but it is often useful to combine the two in more complex interaction scenarios.\nThe specifications below are equivalent:\n\n# Interaction using \":\"\n# including the constituent terms must be done manually\nm2 &lt;- lm(redistribute ~ educ_univ + trusting + educ_univ:trusting + female + employment + hh_income + married + child + politics, data = akaeda)\n\n# Interaction using \"*\"\n# including the constituent terms is done automatically\nm2 &lt;- lm(redistribute ~                        educ_univ*trusting + female + employment + hh_income + married + child + politics, data = akaeda)\nm2 &lt;- lm(redistribute ~ educ_univ + trusting + educ_univ*trusting + female + employment + hh_income + married + child + politics, data = akaeda)\n\nBut the one below is missing the constituent terms and is very likely not what we want:\n\nm2_wrong &lt;- lm(redistribute ~                  educ_univ:trusting + female + employment + hh_income + married + child + politics, data = akaeda)\n\nOut of precaution, it is advisable to use the * operator and to manually include all the constituent terms as well, as in the third version above.\nLet’s then check the model coefficients (parameters):\n\nmodel_parameters(m2)\n\nParameter                                              | Coefficient |       SE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept)                                            |        4.06 |     0.05\neduc univ [University education]                       |       -0.68 |     0.04\ntrusting [Trusting]                                    |        0.16 |     0.04\nfemale [2]                                             |        0.14 |     0.03\nemployment                                             |    5.41e-04 | 5.74e-03\nhh income                                              |        0.03 | 7.71e-03\nmarried [Maried]                                       |       -0.18 |     0.03\nchild [Has children]                                   |       -0.06 |     0.03\npolitics                                               |        0.24 | 6.01e-03\neduc univ [University education] × trusting [Trusting] |        0.40 |     0.06\n\nParameter                                              |         95% CI\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept)                                            | [ 3.96,  4.17]\neduc univ [University education]                       | [-0.76, -0.60]\ntrusting [Trusting]                                    | [ 0.08,  0.23]\nfemale [2]                                             | [ 0.09,  0.20]\nemployment                                             | [-0.01,  0.01]\nhh income                                              | [ 0.01,  0.04]\nmarried [Maried]                                       | [-0.24, -0.12]\nchild [Has children]                                   | [-0.12,  0.00]\npolitics                                               | [ 0.22,  0.25]\neduc univ [University education] × trusting [Trusting] | [ 0.29,  0.52]\n\nParameter                                              | t(40052) |      p\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept)                                            |    75.76 | &lt; .001\neduc univ [University education]                       |   -17.08 | &lt; .001\ntrusting [Trusting]                                    |     4.18 | &lt; .001\nfemale [2]                                             |     5.17 | &lt; .001\nemployment                                             |     0.09 | 0.925 \nhh income                                              |     3.26 | 0.001 \nmarried [Maried]                                       |    -5.97 | &lt; .001\nchild [Has children]                                   |    -2.04 | 0.041 \npolitics                                               |    39.25 | &lt; .001\neduc univ [University education] × trusting [Trusting] |     6.89 | &lt; .001\n\n\nWe can compare our results with those reported in Model 3 (Table 2) of Akaeda (2023), keeping in mind that our data are very different. Nonetheless, we find a similar positive effect for the interaction term (0.41), which in our case is stronger.\nInterpreting interactions\nAs with results from logistic regression models, interpreting interaction results is not straightforward.\nFirst of all, the coefficients associated with the individual variables included in the interaction term can no longer be interpreted in the usual direct way, and we usually no longer interpret the “main effects” of educ_univ and trusting, but only the multiplicative effect of the interaction between them. The interpretation of the numeric results, however, is rather convoluted and prone to lead to misinterpretations. In essence, what we get is the effect of a unit-change in trust among the university-educated compared to the effect of a unit-change in trust among the non-university-educated.\nAs with interpreting logistic regression, it can be much easier and reliable to interpret a plot of the “marginal effects”. As we already know from Lab 4, that can be achieved using the ggpredict() and the plot() functions, and we would add both constitutive terms of the interaction. Depending on which variable we write first we get either the effect of trust by education, or the effect of education by trust:\nEducation by trust:\n\nggpredict(m2, terms = c(\"educ_univ\", \"trusting\")) |&gt; \n  plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust by education:\n\nggpredict(m2, terms = c(\"trusting\", \"educ_univ\")) |&gt; \n  plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter plot reproduces Figure 1 from Akaeda (2023). To get an even closer reproduction of that Figure, we could add an additional argument to the plotting function, asking for the point-predictions to be connected with lines:\n\nggpredict(m2, terms = c(\"trusting\", \"educ_univ\")) |&gt; \n  plot(connect_lines = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at whether and how much the confidence intervals of the predicted coefficients overlap with the point-predictions of the coefficients, we can visually asses the interaction effect. We find that positive differences in the level of social trust have a much steeper effect on redistributive attitudes among the highly educated than it does among the lower educated.",
