The info sheets under  are available in a very rudimentary form, just to give some more boring details about how these planned topics map on to statistical methods that will be covered. The topics marked with an * have a very borderline-significant p-value when tested on the null-hypothesis that they have 0 probability of actually being covered in practice. It will depend somewhat on our interests and the pace of our progress through the previous topics."
