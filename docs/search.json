David, however, thought that this does not stand true also for scientists’ and statisticians’ own emerging interest in their disciplines. He was right, in that the critical examination of the intellectual development of statistics and probability theory that followed has improved the discipline by excavating ideas that had been buried by mainstream statistics, but he was also mistaken, in that this activity threw light on the decadence of mainstream statistical practice. In this lecture we will look back on the development of some basic statistical concepts and learn about the ideas and preoccupations that influenced them over the centuries. The aim of this overview is to build up essential intuition about the concepts and methods that we will learn later. Brains-on activities will include casting astragali, fighting Laplace’s Demon, tasting tea, and comparing peas in a pod. By the end, we will gain a clearer understanding of the limits of statistical analysis and the dangers of not acknowledging those limits.\nThe IT lab will provide a very hands-on practical introduction to the statistical software that will be used in the module.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2  Revisiting Flatland  A review of general linear models\n\n\nIn Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella, the inhabitants of Flatland are geometric shapes living in a two-dimensional world, incapable of imagining the existence of higher dimensions. A sphere passing through the plain of their world is a fascinating but incomprehensible event: Flatlanders can only see a dot becoming a circle, increasing in circumference, then shrinking back in size and disappearing. There are, in this universe, worlds with even more limited views, like the one-dimensional Lineland and the zero-dimensional Pointland. Any attempt to expand the perspective of their inhabitant(s) is doomed to failure. But as in any good adventure story, a chosen Flatland native embarks on a journey of discovery and revelation - and ostracism and imprisonment. The story is interpreted as an allegorical criticism of Victorian-age social structure, but can equally describe the limitations of inhabiting uncritically a methodological world in which all data are ‘normal’ and all relationships are linear. Moving beyond linearity and acquiring the statistical intuition needed to think in higher dimensions and perceive more complex relationships is indeed a matter of practice-induced revelation. It’s unlikely that we will reach statistical nirvana in this short course, but we’ll attempt to build some more substantial structures upon the arid plains of linear regression. We start by looking around in the Flat-, Line- and Point-lands of quantitative analysis. Incorrigible procrastinators may want to check out a full-length computer animated film version of Flatland on YouTube. Others may be better served by this brief TED-Ed animation.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3  Dear Prudence, Help! I may be cheating with my X  Interactions and the logic of causal inference\n\n\nMuch of what we do in quantitative data analysis is about examining relationships. We are often interested in proposing and testing models of relationships between two or more variables. Sometimes our variables cry out to us begging for help, and we turn into agony aunts and uncles to our data. Other times we must psychoanalyse our data to uncover hidden associations and interactions. This is not an easy task. Do it carelessly, and you may unwittingly cheat yourself and the readers of your research. This week we’ll build some intuition for detecting complex and uneasy relationships within the design matrix X - that promiscuous commune on the right-hand-side of our regression equations. We’ll expand on the linear additive models that we looked at in the previous week by considering interactions among our predictor variables, we’ll explore the possibilities and challenges of asking causal questions of observational data, and we’ll think about ways to avoid what evolutionary anthropologist Richard McElreath calls ‘causal salad’. We may get an uncomfortable feeling that we may have cheated with our Xs in the past, but we’ll look towards the future. By the way, Dear Prudence is Slate magazine’s advice column; I like the name because being prudent really is essential in data analysis and interpretation. If you’re done with the readings for this week, you may indulge in some Prudie advice on matters more serious than statistics.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4  The Y question  Generalised linear models\n\n\nIt wasn’t until the last quarter of the 20th century that a unified vision of statistical modelling emerged, allowing practitioners to see how the general linear model we have explored so far is only a specific case of a more general class of models. We could have had a fancy, memorable name for this class of models - as John Nelder, one of its inventors, acknowledged later in life (Senn 2003:127) - but back then academics were not required to undertake marketing training on the tweetabilty-factor of the chosen names for their theories; so we ended up with “generalised linear models”. These models can be applied to explananda (“explained”, “response”, “outcome”, “dependent” etc. variables, our ys) whose possible values have certain constraints (such as being limited by a lower bound or constrained to discreet choices) that makes the parameters of the Gaussian (‘normal’) distribution inefficient in describing them. Instead, they follow some of the other “exponential distributions” (and not only the exponential: cf. Gelman et al. (2020:264)), of which the Poisson, gamma, beta, binomial and multinomial are probably the most common in human and social sciences research. Their “generalised linear modelling” involves mapping them unto a linear model using a so-called “link function”. We will explore what all of this means in practice and how it can be applied to data that we are interested in most in our respective fields of study.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5  Do we live in a simulation?  Basic data simulation for statistical inference and power analysis\n\n\nWe have known ever since science-fiction author Philip K. Dick’s memorable “Metz address” of 1977 that our world is a computer simulation. Of course, like some common-currency theories in the social sciences, this knowledge will never be truly verified. We won’t even attempt to get to the bottom of it in class; instead, we’ll practice some basic methods of computer simulation for statistical inference and for generating data that has some idealised characteristics. Such methods play an increasingly important role in computational statistics and are extremely useful for designing robust data collection and analysis plans. If you make a mistake in the code and end up in an infinite loop, but you’re afraid that stopping the process may cause the known universe to implode, you can watch Dick on YouTube while you wait. If something like this can happen to our data, who says it couldn’t happen to us?\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6  Challenging hierarchies  Multilevel models\n\n\nBy now we got a sense that every new thing we learn about turns out to be merely a specific case of a larger class of things. So, all the models we covered so far are specific, single-level, versions of multilevel models, in which our cases can be seen as clustered within larger entities. Sometimes they are part of several cross-cutting clusters and/or the clusters are themselves clustered. In general terms, we must acknowledge that there are dependencies in our data that may influence their behaviour. It turns out that data about humans living in societies look somewhat like humans living in societies. The importance of including information about hierarchical dependencies in our models is probably emphasised by no one else more than McElreath (2020:15), who wants “to convince the reader of something that appears unreasonable: multilevel regression deserves to be the default form of regression. Papers that do not use multilevel models should have to justify not using a multilevel approach.” We will encounter some of the uses and challenges of multilevel modelling.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7  The unobserved  Latent variables and structural models\n\n\nThe unobserved sounds like the title of a promising horror film; if we have achieved our aims in the module so far, our horror should be ‘merely’ metaphysical by now (Kołakowski anyone? No? Okay, never mind). We have already had to deal with various aspects of latency in our analyses. At the most fundamental level, we speak about population parameters, but we never actually observe them; even a sample statistic can be a purely imaginary case that doesn’t occur in real life. We have discussed the effects of omitted variables, which are thus unobserved by our model, but which we may have access to in our data. And, of course, our most interesting measurements are likely to be proxies of some unobservable theoretical construct (Mulvin (2021) has recently published a wonderfully rich book about proxies in general). This week we pick up an earlier thread from week 4, where we thought about binary and ordered multinomial variables as discretised manifestations of some continuous ‘latent variable’. We expand on this idea by exploring simple and then more complex latent variable models (factor analysis, structural equation modelling), as a further generalisation of the hierarchical perspective introduced earlier. This gives us a few more tools to deal with our radical uncertainty. (n.b. missing data points are another challenge that could fall under this heading, and learning how to deal with them is extremely important; but “The missing” is too good a title not to deserve a high-budget, weak-storyline, full-on special effects sequel somewhere else)\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8  Words, words, mere words…  Text as data\n\n\nAs researchers in humanities and the social sciences, we use words both as tools of analysis and as sources of data. Words, and more broadly, texts, are also increasingly important for quantitative research in an age of so-called ‘big data’, when the digital world is saturated with unstructured textual information. But the statistical inspection of text is neither new, nor restricted to the humanistic tail of the social sciences. For example, a documented interest in the statistical study of literary style for the purposes of attributing authorship dates back to the mid-1850s (see El-Shagi and Jung 2015); and investors can use textual data such as minutes from the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee’s deliberations to estimate future monetary policy decisions before they are actually taken (cf. Lord 1958). Methods for the collection and quantitative analysis of large-scale textual data are increasingly available, but their technical implementation is complex and requires efficient combination of humanistic subject knowledge and statistical expertise. Faced with words, one is understandably caught between Shakespeare’s Troilus and Wilde’s Dorian Gray. “Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart; th’ effect doth operate another way. … My love with words and errors still she feeds, but edifies another with her deeds” - believed the betrayed Troilus. “Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?” - pondered Dorian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDavid, F. N. 1955. “Studies in the History of Probability and Statistics i.

    "text": "Importing data\nAs we have seen in Week 1, small datasets that are included in R packages (including base R) for demonstration purposes can be used by simply invoking the name of the dataset. For example, the command head(mtcars) would print out the first 5 rows (cases) in the “mtcars” dataset included in base R (more specifically, in its “datasets” package):\n\nhead(mtcars)\n\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe data() function lists all the built-in packages. You can further specify package = to list datasets included in a given package; e.g.:\n\ndata(package = \"dplyr\")\n\n# Note that {dplyr} is one of the data management packages included in the core {tidyverse}. Make sure the {tidyverse} is installed.\n\n\n\nWe can also import built-in datasets to our Environment in order to inspect them manually:\n\nmtcars_data <- mtcars\n\nIf we want to access a dataset from a non-base-R package, we need to ensure that the package is installed on our system and that we specify the name of the package; e.g.:\n\nhead(starwars) # gives an Error\n\nError in head(starwars): object 'starwars' not found\n\nhead(dplyr::starwars)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 14\n  name         height  mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex   gender homew…⁵\n  <chr>         <int> <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl> <chr> <chr>  <chr>  \n1 Luke Skywal…    172    77 blond   fair    blue       19   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n2 C-3PO           167    75 <NA>    gold    yellow    112   none  mascu… Tatooi…\n3 R2-D2            96    32 <NA>    white,… red        33   none  mascu… Naboo  \n4 Darth Vader     202   136 none    white   yellow     41.9 male  mascu… Tatooi…\n5 Leia Organa     150    49 brown   light   brown      19   fema… femin… Aldera…\n6 Owen Lars       178   120 brown,… light   blue       52   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n# … with 4 more variables: species <chr>, films <list>, vehicles <list>,\n#   starships <list>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color,\n#   ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld\n\n  # works, as long as {dplyr} or the whole {tidyverse} are installed\n\nReal-life datasets, however, need to be imported into R. Datasets come in various formats. R’s native data format has the extension .rds and can be imported with the readRDS() function. The counterpart function saveRDS() exports a dataset to the .rds format. The core-tidyverse {readr} package has similar functions (read_rds() / write_rds()).\nThe .rds format is useful because it can be compressed to various sizes to take up less space, but can only be directly opened in R. It is much more common to encounter data saved in a “delimited” text format, which can be easily opened in a spreadsheet viewer/editor such as Excel. This makes it very interchangeable and therefore very common. The most common is probably the “comma separated values” (.csv) format, which can be imported with the base-R function read.csv() or the tidyverse readr::read_csv() equivalent. Read Chapter 11 in R4DS for more on these functions.\nVery often, you will need to import data saved in the format of another proprietary statistical analysis package such as SPSS or Stata. Large survey projects usually make data available in these formats. The great advantage of these formats is that they can incorporate additional information about variables and the levels of categorical variables (e.g. value labels, specific values for different types of missing values). These additional information can be extremely valuable, but they are not handled straight-forwardly in text-based format, spreadsheets and R’s native data format. To make them operational in R, we need a few specially designed functions.\nThe {haven} package — part of the extended {tidyverse}, meaning that it is installed on your system as part of {tidyverse}, but the library(\"tidyverse\") command does not load it by default; it needs to be loaded explicitly — is one of the most commonly used for this purpose. Functions such as read_sas(), read_sav() and read_dta() import datasets specific to the SAS, SPSS and Stata programs, respectively.\nIt is highly recommended to read the documentation available for the {haven} package to understand how it operates. Fundamentally, it is designed to import data to a intermediary format which stores the additional labeling information in a special format that allows users to access them, but not making them easy to use directly. A suite of packages developed by Daniel Lüdecke from the University of Hamburg offer some additional functionality to work with labels directly when summarising and plotting data. These packages integrate well with the {tidyverse} and are actively maintained, and we will use them in this course to make our lives a bit easier. To install them, run:\n\n# We can install several packages at once by first creating a vector of their names\n\nsj_packages <- c(\"sjlabelled\", \"sjPlot\", \"sjstats\", \"ggeffects\", \"sjmisc\")\n\ninstall.packages(sj_packages)\n\nThe functions sjlabelled::read_sas(), sjlabelled::read_spss() and sjlabelled::read_stata() are the {sjlabelled} equivalents of the {haven} functions mentioned above. This vignette article included with the package explains the main differences between the two.\nAs a first step, let’s import the osterman dataset that underpins the Österman (2021) article (see the Data page on the course website for information about the datasets available in this course):\n\nosterman <- sjlabelled::read_stata(\"https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005-data/osterman.dta\")\n\n\nUsing functions learnt in Week 1, do the following:\n\ncheck the dimensions of the dataset; what does it tell you?\nprint a summary of the entire dataset; what have you learnt about the data?\n\n\nA very convenient way to create a codeplan for a dataset – especially if it has value-labelled categorical variables – is offered by the sjPlot::view_df() function, which produces a tables in HTML format that can be saved and consulted to get more information about the variables. With the default settings, we get the following:\n\nsjPlot::view_df(osterman)\n\nThe output opens up in the Viewer pane.\nThere are several additional options that can add useful complexity to the codeplan, as well as the option to restrict it to selected variables. It also works in a “piper” workflow, so it can be combined with {dplyr} verbs such as select to restrict variables beforehand in a more flexible way. Below we request a codeplan with extended options:\n\nsjPlot::view_df(osterman,\n                show.na = TRUE, \n                show.type = TRUE, \n                show.frq = TRUE, \n                show.prc = TRUE, \n                show.string.values = TRUE)\n\nThe output can also be opened in an external web browser window by clicking on the third (last) icon at the top of the Viewer toolbar. From the browser window, with a Ctrl + Right-click > Save as... we can save the table as an HTML document locally and use it as a reference.\n\nBefore moving forward, spend some time examining the codeplan that you have produced and if you haven’t yet had a chance to skim through the Österman (2021) article, have a quick read through their description of the dataset."

You will likely need to continue the task outside class. If you succeed in complating the Task, in Week 3 we can compare results."
