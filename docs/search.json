The module aims to provide a broad applied introduction to more advanced methods in quantitative analysis for students from various disciplinary backgrounds. See the module plan page for details about the methods covered. The course content consists of eight lectures (1.5 hours each) and eight IT labs (1.5 hours) . The course stands on three pillars: application, reproducibility and computation.\nApplication: we will work with real data originating from large-scale representative surveys or published research, with the aim of applying methods to concrete research scenarios. IT lab exercises will involve reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. The aim is to see how methods have been used in practice in various disciplines and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable students to apply this knowledge to their own research questions. The data used in IT labs may be cleansed to allow focusing more on modelling tasks than on data wrangling, but exercises will address some of the more common data manipulation challenges and will cover essential functions. Data cleansing scripts will also be provided so that interested students can use them in their own work.\nReproducibility: developing a reproducible workflow that allows your future self or a reviewer of your work to understand your process of analysis and reproduce your results is essential for reliable and collaborative scientific research. We enforce the ideas and procedures of reproducible research both through replicating published research (see above) and in our practice (in the IT labs and the assignment). For an overview of why it’s important to develop a reproducible workflow early on in your research career and how to do it using (some) of the tools used in this module, read Chapter 3 of TSD (see Resources>Readings). It’s also worth reading through Kieran Healy’s The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science, although there are now better software options than those discussed there. In this course, we will be using a suite of well-integrated free and open-source software to aid our reproducible workflow: the  statistical programming language and its currently most popular dialect – the {tidyverse} – via the  IDE for data analysis, and  for scientific writing and publishing (see Resources>Software).\nComputation: the development of computational methods underpins the application of the most important statistical ideas of the past 50 years (see Andrew Gelman’s article on these developments here or an online workshop talk here; Richard McElreath’s great talk on Science as Amateur Software Development is well worth watching too). This module aims to develop basic computational skills that allow the application of complex statistical models to practical scientific problems without advanced mathematical knowledge, and which lay the foundation on which students can then pursue further learning and research in computational humanities and social sciences.\n\nThe course and the website were written and are maintained by Chris Moreh. The source-code is available on  GitHub\n\n\nPrerequisites\nTo benefit the most from this module, students are expected to have a foundational level of knowledge in quantitative methods: a good understanding of data types and distributions, familiarity with inferential statistics, and some exposure to linear regression. This is roughly equivalent to the content covered in the Introductory stream of the module or a textbook such as OpenIntro Statistics (which you can download for free in PDF).\nThose who don’t feel completely up to date with linear regression but are determined to advance more quickly and read/practice beyond the compulsory material during weeks 1-3 are also encouraged to sign up.\nThose with a stronger background in multiple linear regression (e.g. students with undergraduate-level training in econometrics) will still benefit from weeks 1-3 as the approach we are taking is probably different from the one they are familiar with.\nNo previous knowledge of  or command-based statistical analysis software is needed. Gaining experience with using statistical software is part of the skills development aims of the module. However, it is not a general data science module, and the IT labs will cover a very limited number of functions (from both base R, the tidyverse and other reliable user-written packages) that are most useful for tackling specific analysis tasks. Students are advised to complete some additional self-paced free online training in the use of the software, such as Data Carpentry’s R for Social Scientists, and to consult Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund’s R for Data Science (2nd ed.) online book."

    "text": "Title\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nReading Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamblers, God, Guinness and peas\n\n\nIn the first contribution to a series of articles on the history of probability and statistics in the journal Biometrika, Florence Nightingale David (1955) (no linear relationship with the famous social reformer) paraphrased a contemporary archaeologist who quipped that “a symptom of decadence in a civilization is when men become interested in their own history”, giving the interest in his own discipline as proof of the validity of his statement. David, however, thought that this does not stand true also for scientists’ and statisticians’ own emerging interest in their disciplines. He was right, in that the critical examination of the intellectual development of statistics and probability theory that followed has improved the discipline by excavating ideas that had been buried by mainstream statistics, but he was also mistaken, in that this activity threw light on the decadence of mainstream statistical practice. In this lecture we will look back on the development of some basic statistical concepts and learn about the ideas and preoccupations that influenced them over the centuries. The aim of this overview is to build up essential intuition about the concepts and methods that we will learn later. Brains-on activities will include casting astragali, fighting Laplace’s Demon, tasting tea, and comparing peas in a pod. By the end, we will gain a clearer understanding of the limits of statistical analysis and the dangers of not acknowledging those limits.\nThe IT lab will provide a very hands-on practical introduction to the statistical software that will be used in the module.\n\n\n0 min\n\n\n\n\nRevisiting Flatland\n\n\nIn Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella, the inhabitants of Flatland are geometric shapes living in a two-dimensional world, incapable of imagining the existence of higher dimensions. A sphere passing through the plain of their world is a fascinating but incomprehensible event: Flatlanders can only see a dot becoming a circle, increasing in circumference, then shrinking back in size and disappearing. There are, in this universe, worlds with even more limited views, like the one-dimensional Lineland and the zero-dimensional Pointland. Any attempt to expand the perspective of their inhabitant(s) is doomed to failure. But as in any good adventure story, a chosen Flatland native embarks on a journey of discovery and revelation - and ostracism and imprisonment. The story is interpreted as an allegorical criticism of Victorian-age social structure, but can equally describe the limitations of inhabiting uncritically a methodological world in which all data are ‘normal’ and all relationships are linear. Moving beyond linearity and acquiring the statistical intuition needed to think in higher dimensions and perceive more complex relationships is indeed a matter of practice-induced revelation. It’s unlikely that we will reach statistical nirvana in this short course, but we’ll attempt to build some more substantial structures upon the arid plains of linear regression. We start by looking around in the Flat-, Line- and Point-lands of quantitative analysis. Incorrigible procrastinators may want to check out a full-length computer animated film version of Flatland on YouTube. Others may be better served by this brief TED-Ed animation.\n\n\n0 min\n\n\n\n\nDear Prudence, Help! I may be cheating with my X\n\n\nMuch of what we do in quantitative data analysis is about examining relationships. We are often interested in proposing and testing models of relationships between two or more variables. Sometimes our variables cry out to us begging for help, and we turn into agony aunts and uncles to our data. Other times we must psychoanalyse our data to uncover hidden associations and interactions. This is not an easy task. Do it carelessly, and you may unwittingly cheat yourself and the readers of your research. This week we’ll build some intuition for detecting complex and uneasy relationships within the design matrix X - that promiscuous commune on the right-hand-side of our regression equations. We’ll expand on the linear additive models that we looked at in the previous week by considering interactions among our predictor variables, we’ll explore the possibilities and challenges of asking causal questions of observational data, and we’ll think about ways to avoid what evolutionary anthropologist Richard McElreath calls ‘causal salad’. We may get an uncomfortable feeling that we may have cheated with our Xs in the past, but we’ll look towards the future. By the way, Dear Prudence is Slate magazine’s advice column; I like the name because being prudent really is essential in data analysis and interpretation. If you’re done with the readings for this week, you may indulge in some Prudie advice on matters more serious than statistics.\n\n\n0 min\n\n\n\n\nThe Y question\n\n\nIt wasn’t until the last quarter of the 20th century that a unified vision of statistical modelling emerged, allowing practitioners to see how the general linear model we have explored so far is only a specific case of a more general class of models. We could have had a fancy, memorable name for this class of models - as John Nelder, one of its inventors, acknowledged later in life (Senn 2003, 127) - but back then academics were not required to undertake marketing training on the tweetabilty-factor of the chosen names for their theories; so we ended up with “generalised linear models”. These models can be applied to explananda (“explained”, “response”, “outcome”, “dependent” etc. variables, our ys) whose possible values have certain constraints (such as being limited by a lower bound or constrained to discreet choices) that makes the parameters of the Gaussian (‘normal’) distribution inefficient in describing them. Instead, they follow some of the other “exponential distributions” (and not only the exponential: cf. Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020, 264)), of which the Poisson, gamma, beta, binomial and multinomial are probably the most common in human and social sciences research. Their “generalised linear modelling” involves mapping them unto a linear model using a so-called “link function”. We will explore what all of this means in practice and how it can be applied to data that we are interested in most in our respective fields of study.\n\n\n0 min\n\n\n\n\nDo we live in a simulation?\n\n\nWe have known ever since science-fiction author Philip K. Dick’s memorable “Metz address” of 1977 that our world is a computer simulation. Of course, like some common-currency theories in the social sciences, this knowledge will never be truly verified. We won’t even attempt to get to the bottom of it in class; instead, we’ll practice some basic methods of computer simulation for statistical inference and for generating data that has some idealised characteristics. Such methods play an increasingly important role in computational statistics and are extremely useful for designing robust data collection and analysis plans. If you make a mistake in the code and end up in an infinite loop, but you’re afraid that stopping the process may cause the known universe to implode, you can watch Dick on YouTube while you wait. If something like this can happen to our data, who says it couldn’t happen to us?\n\n\n0 min\n\n\n\n\nChallenging hierarchies\n\n\nBy now we got a sense that every new thing we learn about turns out to be merely a specific case of a larger class of things. So, all the models we covered so far are specific, single-level, versions of multilevel models, in which our cases can be seen as clustered within larger entities. Sometimes they are part of several cross-cutting clusters and/or the clusters are themselves clustered. In general terms, we must acknowledge that there are dependencies in our data that may influence their behaviour. It turns out that data about humans living in societies look somewhat like humans living in societies. The importance of including information about hierarchical dependencies in our models is probably emphasised by no one else more than McElreath (2020, 15), who wants “to convince the reader of something that appears unreasonable: multilevel regression deserves to be the default form of regression. Papers that do not use multilevel models should have to justify not using a multilevel approach.” We will encounter some of the uses and challenges of multilevel modelling.\n\n\n0 min\n\n\n\n\nThe unobserved\n\n\nThe unobserved sounds like the title of a promising horror film; if we have achieved our aims in the module so far, our horror should be ‘merely’ metaphysical by now (Kołakowski anyone? No? Okay, never mind). We have already had to deal with various aspects of latency in our analyses. At the most fundamental level, we speak about population parameters, but we never actually observe them; even a sample statistic can be a purely imaginary case that doesn’t occur in real life. We have discussed the effects of omitted variables, which are thus unobserved by our model, but which we may have access to in our data. And, of course, our most interesting measurements are likely to be proxies of some unobservable theoretical construct (Mulvin (2021) has recently published a wonderfully rich book about proxies in general). This week we pick up an earlier thread from week 4, where we thought about binary and ordered multinomial variables as discretised manifestations of some continuous ‘latent variable’. We expand on this idea by exploring simple and then more complex latent variable models (factor analysis, structural equation modelling), as a further generalisation of the hierarchical perspective introduced earlier. This gives us a few more tools to deal with our radical uncertainty. (n.b. missing data points are another challenge that could fall under this heading, and learning how to deal with them is extremely important; but “The missing” is too good a title not to deserve a high-budget, weak-storyline, full-on special effects sequel somewhere else)\n\n\n0 min\n\n\n\n\nWords, words, mere words…\n\n\nAs researchers in humanities and the social sciences, we use words both as tools of analysis and as sources of data. Words, and more broadly, texts, are also increasingly important for quantitative research in an age of so-called ‘big data’, when the digital world is saturated with unstructured textual information. But the statistical inspection of text is neither new, nor restricted to the humanistic tail of the social sciences. For example, a documented interest in the statistical study of literary style for the purposes of attributing authorship dates back to the mid-1850s (see El-Shagi and Jung 2015); and investors can use textual data such as minutes from the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee’s deliberations to estimate future monetary policy decisions before they are actually taken (cf. Lord 1958). Methods for the collection and quantitative analysis of large-scale textual data are increasingly available, but their technical implementation is complex and requires efficient combination of humanistic subject knowledge and statistical expertise. Faced with words, one is understandably caught between Shakespeare’s Troilus and Wilde’s Dorian Gray. “Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart; th’ effect doth operate another way. … My love with words and errors still she feeds, but edifies another with her deeds” - believed the betrayed Troilus. “Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?” - pondered Dorian.\n\n\n0 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReferences\n\nDavid, F. N. 1955. “Studies in the History of Probability and Statistics i.

    "text": "This lab is an introduction to R and RStudio for the purposes of this module. It is expected that those new to R will complete the R for Social Scientists online training course on their own (estimated to take around 5-6 hours), as well as read through the assigned chapters from the R4DS textbook. The aims of this session are more limited than the contents of those resources, while at the same time offering something additional to those already familiar with basic operations in R.\nBy the end of the session, you will:\n\nunderstand how to use the most important panels in the RStudio interface\ncreate an RStudio Project to store your work throughout the course\nbegin using R scripts (.R) and Quarto notebooks (.qmd) to record and document your coding progress\nunderstand data types and basic operations in the R language\nunderstand the principles behind functions\n\nknow how to install, load and use functions from user-written packages\ngain familiarity with some useful functions from packages included in the tidyverse ecosystem\nThese few tasks should be enough to get you started with R and RStudio. If you haven’t yet done so, complete the R for Social Scientists online training too sometime over the next week. From next week we will begin working actively with real data and address specific data management challenges that arise from there.\nThose of you who have worked on the advanced user exercise can check some optional solutions below."

    "text": "R and RStudio\nIf you are working on university desktops in the IT labs, recent versions of both R and RStudio will already be installed. To install them on your personal computers, follow the steps outlined here based on your operating system.\nAlthough you will likely only interact directly with RStudio, R needs to be installed first. Think of the relationship between the two as that between the engine of a car (R) and the dashboard of a car (RStudio); or, imagine driving this (R) versus this (RStudio).\nYour first task is to take RStudio for a spin and get to know some of its more commonly used panes. The four main panes are:\n\nThe R Console Pane\nThe R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R “engine”. This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. The Console is the direct interface to the R software itself; it’s what we get if instead of RStudio we open the R software: a direct interface to the R programming language, where we can type commands and where results/messages are printed.\nYou can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script. For this reason, we should not use the Console pane directly too much. For typing commands that we want R to execute, we should instead use an R script file, where everything we type can be saved for later and complex analyses can be built up.\nThe Source Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-left, is a space to work with scripts and other text files. This pane is also where datasets (data frames) open up for viewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote\nIf your RStudio displays only one pane on the left, it is because you have no scripts open yet. We can open an existing one or create a new one. We’ ll do that a bit later.\n\n\nThe Environment Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of “objects” that are available in an active session. Datasets loaded for analysis would appear here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote\nIf your Environment is empty, it means that you don’t have any “objects” loaded or created yet. We will be creating some objects later and we will also import an example dataset.\n\n\nFiles, Plots, Packages, Help, etc. The lower-right pane includes several tabs including plots (display of graphics including maps), help, a file library, and available R packages (including installation/update options).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTip\nYou can arrange the panes in various ways, depending on your preferences, using Tools > Global Options in the top menu. So the arrangement of panes may look different on different computers.\n\n\nGeneral settings\nYou can personalise the look and feel of your RStudio setup in various ways using Tools > Global Options from the top menu, but setting some options as default from the very start is highly recommended. You can see these in the pictures below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important setting in the picture on the left is the one to restore .RData at startup and saving the workspace as .RData on exit. Make sure these are un-ticked and set to ‘Never’, respectively, as shown in the picture. It’s always safer to start each RStudio session in a clean state, without anything automatically pre-loaded from a previos session. That could lead to serious and hard to trace complications.\nIn the picture on the right, you have the option to select that the new native pipe operator (we’ll talk about it later!) be inserted using the Ctrl+Shift+M keyboard shortcut instead of the older version of the pipe (|>).\n\nThese settings will make more sense later, but it’s a good idea to have them sorted at the very beginning."

    "section": "Task 1: Use R as a simple calculator",
    "text": "Task 1: Use R as a simple calculator\nThe most elementary yet still handy task you can use R for is to perform basic arithmetic operations. This is useful for getting a first experience doing things in the R language. Let’s have a look at a few operations using the Console directly. Let’s say we want to know the result of adding up three numbers: 1, 3 and 5. In the Console pane, type the command below and then click Enter:\n\n1 + 3 + 5\n\nThis will print out the result (9) in the Console:\n\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nThe [1] in the result is just the line number; in this case, our result only consists of a single line.\nWe can also save the result of this operation as an object, so we can use it for further operations. We create objects by using the so-called assignment operator consisting of the characters <-. A command involving <- can be read as “assign the value of the result from the operation on the right hand side (some expression) to the object on the left hand side (short name of object, single word, with no spaces)”. For example, let’s save our result in an object called “nine”:\n\nnine <- 1 + 3 + 5\n\nNotice that there is no output printed in the Console this time. But there are also no error messages, so the operation must have run without problems. Instead, if we look at the Environment pane, we notice that it is no longer empty, but contains an object called “nine” that stores the value “9” in it. We can now use this object for other operations, such as:\n\nnine - 3\n\n[1] 6\n\nnine + 15\n\n[1] 24\n\nnine / 3\n\n[1] 3\n\nnine * 9\n\n[1] 81\n\n\nWe see the results of these operations printed out in the Console.\nWe can also check results of so-called relational operations. There are several relational operators that allow us to compare objects in R. The most useful of these are the following:\n\n\n> greater than, >= greater than or equal to\n\n< less than, <= less than or equal to\n\n== equal to\n\n!= not equal to\n\nWhen we use these to compare two objects in R, we end us with a logical object.\nFor example, let’s check whether 9 is greater than 5, and whether it is lower than 8:\n\n9 > 5\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n9 < 8\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nR treats our inputs as statements that we are asking it to evaluate, and we get the answers “TRUE” and “FALSE”, respectively, as we would expect. Let’s now check whether our object “nine” is equal to the number 9. We may assume that we can achieve this by typing “nine = 9”, but let’s see what that results in:\n\nnine = 9\n\nDid we get the result we expected? Nothing was printed in the output, so seemingly nothing happened… That’s because the “=” sign is also used as an assignment operator in R, just like “<-”. So we basically assigned the value “9” to the object “nine” again. To use the equal sign as a logical operator we must type it twice (==). Let’s see:\n\nnine == 9\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nNow we get the answer “TRUE”, as expected.\nThis distinction between “=” and “==” is important to keep in mind. What would have happened if we had tried to test whether our object “nine” equals value “5” or not, and instead of the logical operator (==) we used the assignment operator (=)? Let’s see:\n\nnine = 5\n\nIn the Console we again see no results printed, but if we check our Environment, we see that the value of the object “nine” was changed to 5. So it can be a dangerous business. We’ll be using the “<-” as assignment operator instead of “=” to avoid any confusion in this respect. The distinction between == and = will also emerge in other contexts later.\nSo, try out the following commands in turn now and check if the results are what you’d expect:\n\nnine == 9\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nnine == 5\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nfive <- 9\nnine == five\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nfive = nine\nnine == five\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nnine + five <= 10 # lower than or equal to ...\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThe text following the hashtag (#) in the last line is a comment. If you’d like to comment on any code you write just add a hash (#) or series of hashes in front of it so that R knows it should not evaluate it as a command. This will be useful when writing your commands in an R script that you can save for later, rather than interacting with R live in the Console."

    "text": "Scripts, markdown documents and projects\nBefore learning to do more with R, let’s learn about some further file types and complete our RStudio setup. Writing brief commands that you want to test out in the Console is okay, but what you really want is to save your commands as part of a workflow in a dedicated file that you can reuse, extend and share with others. In every quantitative analysis, we need to ensure that each step in our analysis is traceable and reproducible. This is increasingly a professional standard expected of all data analysts in the social sciences. This means that we need to have an efficient way in which to share our analysis code, as well as our outputs and interpretations of our findings. RStudio has an efficient way of handling this requirement with the use of R script files and versions of the Markdown markup language that allow the efficient combining of plain text (as in the main body of an article) with analysis code and outputs produced in R. The table below lists the main characteristics of these file types:\n\n\nFormat\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\nR Script\n.R\nUse an R script if you want to document a large amount of code used for a particular analysis project. Scripts should contain working R commands and human-readable comments explaining the code. Commands can be run line-by-line, or the whole R script can be run at once. For example, one can write an R script containing a few hundred or thousands of lines of code that gathers and prepares raw, unruly data for analysis; if this script can run without any errors, then it can be saved and sourced from within another script that contains code that undertakes the analysis using the cleansed dataset. Comments can be added by appending them with a hashtag (#).\n\n\nR Markdown\n.Rmd\n\nMarkdown is a simple markup language that allows the formatting of plain text documents. R Markdown is a version of this language written by the R Studio team, which also allows for R code to be included. Plain text documents having the .Rmd extension and containing R Markdown-specific code can be “knitted” (exported) directly into published output document formats such as HTML, PDF or Microsoft Word, which contain both normal text as well as tables and charts produced with the embedded R code. The code itself can also be printed to the output documents.\n\n\nQuarto document\n.qmd\nQuarto is a newer version of R Markdown which allows better compatibility with other programming languages. It is a broader ecosystem design for academic publishing and communication (for example, the course website was built using quarto), but you will be using only Quarto documents in this module. There isn’t much difference between .Rmd and .qmd documents for their uses-cases on this module, so one could easily change and .Rmd extension to .qmd and still produce the same output. .qmd documents are “rendered” instead of “knitted”, but for RStudio users the underlying engine doing the conversion from Quarto/R Markdown to standard Markdown to output file (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) is the same. Read more about Quarto document in the TSD textbook.\n\n\n\nCreating new files can be done easily via the options File > New File >  from the top RStudio menu.\nThe best way to use these files are as part of R project folders, which allow for cross-references to documents and datasets to be made relative to the path of the project folder root. This makes sure that no absolute paths to files (i.e. things like “C:/Documents/Chris/my_article/data_files/my_dataset.rds”) need to be used (instead, you would write something like “~/data_files/my_dataset.rds” if the “my_article” folder was set up as an R Project). This allows for the same code file to be run on another computer too without an error, ensuring a minimal expected level of reproducibility in your workflow.\nSetting up an existing or a new folder as an R Project involves having a file with the extension .RProj saved in it. This can be done easily via the options File > New Project from the top RStudio menu."

    "text": "Task 3: Vector operations in the R script\nLet’s learn a few vector operations. Type/copy the code below to the R script file we created earlier, and save it at the end for your records.\nFirst, let’s use the c() function to concatenate vector elements:\n\nx <- c(2.2, 6.2, 1.2, 5.5, 20.1)\n\nTo run this line of code in an R script, place the cursor on the line you want to execute and either click on the small “Run” tab in the upper-right corner of the script’s task bar, or click Ctrl+Enter (on Windows PCs).\nThe vector called x that we just created appears in the Environment. We can examine some of its features:\n\nclass(x)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\ntypeof(x)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\nlength(x)\n\n[1] 5\n\nattributes(x)\n\nNULL\n\n\nThese tell us something about the characteristics of the object, but not much about its content (apart from the fact that it has a length of 5). Functions such as min, max, range, mean, median, sum or summary give us some summary statistics about the object:\n\nmin(x)\n\n[1] 1.2\n\nmax(x)\n\n[1] 20.1\n\nrange(x)\n\n[1]  1.2 20.1\n\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 7.04\n\nmedian(x)\n\n[1] 5.5\n\nsum(x)\n\n[1] 35.2\n\nsummary(x)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   1.20    2.20    5.50    7.04    6.20   20.10 \n\n\nThe seq() function lets us create a sequence from a starting point to an ending point. If you specify the by argument, you can skip values. For instance, if we wanted a vector of every 5th number between 0 and 100, we could write:\n\nnumbers <- seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 5)\n\nTo print out the result in the console, we can simply type the name of the object:\n\nnumbers\n\n [1]   0   5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90\n[20]  95 100\n\n\nA shorthand version to get a sequence between two numbers counting by 1s is to use the : sign. For example, print out all the numbers between 200 and 250:\n\n200:250\n\n [1] 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218\n[20] 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237\n[39] 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250\n\n\nTo access a single element of a vector by position in the vector, use the square brackets []:\n\nx[2]\n\n[1] 6.2\n\n\nIf you want to access more than one element of a vector, put a vector of the positions you want to access in the brackets:\n\nx[c(2, 5)]\n\n[1]  6.2 20.1\n\n\nIf you try to access an element past the length of the vector, it will return a missing value NA:\n\nx[10]\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nIf you accidentally subset a vector by NA (the missing value), you get the vector back with all its entries replaced by NA:\n\nx[NA]\n\n[1] NA NA NA NA NA\n\n\nLet’s say you want to modify one value in your vector. You can combine the square bracket subset [] with the assignment operator <- to replace a particular value:\n\nx\n\n[1]  2.2  6.2  1.2  5.5 20.1\n\nx[3] <- 50.3\nx\n\n[1]  2.2  6.2 50.3  5.5 20.1\n\n\nYou can replace multiple values at the same time by using a vector for subsetting:\n\nx\n\n[1]  2.2  6.2 50.3  5.5 20.1\n\nx[1:2] <- c(-1.3, 42)\nx\n\n[1] -1.3 42.0 50.3  5.5 20.1\n\n\nIf the replacement vector (the right-hand side) is shorter than what you are assigning to (the left-hand side), the values will “recycle” or repeat as necessary:\n\nx[1:2] <- 3.2\nx\n\n[1]  3.2  3.2 50.3  5.5 20.1\n\nx[1:4] <- c(1.2, 2.4)\nx\n\n[1]  1.2  2.4  1.2  2.4 20.1\n\n\nYou can also create a vector of characters (words, letters, punctuation, etc):\n\njedi <- c(\"Yoda\", \"Obi-Wan\", \"Luke\", \"Leia\", \"Rey\")\n\nNote for vectors, you cannot mix characters and numbers in the same vector. If you add a single character element, the whole vector gets converted.\n\n### output is numeric\nx\n\n[1]  1.2  2.4  1.2  2.4 20.1\n\n### output is now character\nc(x, \"hey\")\n\n[1] \"1.2\"  \"2.4\"  \"1.2\"  \"2.4\"  \"20.1\" \"hey\" \n\n\nLogical vectors are just vectors that only contain the special R values TRUE or FALSE.\n\nlogical <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)\nlogical\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nYou could but never should shorten TRUE to T and FALSE to F. It’s easy for this shortening to go wrong so better just to spell out the full word. Also not that this is case-sensitive, and this will produce an error:\n\ntrue\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'true' not found\n\nTrue\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'True' not found\n\nfalse\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'false' not found"

In a data frame each column is a variable and each row is a case. They look like spreadsheets containing data. There are several toy data frames built into R, and we can have a look at one to see how it looks like.

This makes R extremely powerful and extendible. We’re not going to cover making your own functions in this course, but it’s important to be aware of this capability. There are plenty of good resources online for learning how to do this, including this one.\nAdvanced user exercise: leap year functions\nIf you have more advanced knowledge of R, here’s and exercise for you. Suppose you want to write a function that lists all the leap years between two specified years. How would you go about writing it? What are the information that you need first? What are the steps that you would take to build up the function? There are several ways of achieving such a function, and you can find three options at the bottom of this worksheet. Work individually or in a small group. Compare your results to the options given at the end."

    "section": "Packages",
    "text": "Packages\nInstead of programming your own functions in the R language, you can rely on functions written by other people and bundled within a package that performs some set task. There are a large number of reliable, tested and oft-used packages containing functions that are particularly useful for social scientists.\nSome particularly useful packages: - the tidyverse bundle of packages, which includes the dplyr package (for data manipulation) and additional R packages for reading in (readr), transforming (tidyr) and visualizing (ggplot2) datasets. - to import datasets in non-native formats and to manage attached labels (a concept familiar from other statistical packages but foreign to R), load the sjlabelled package (an alternative to haven and labelled, which work in a similar way but provide less functionality) - the sjmisc package contains very useful functions for undertaking data transformations on labelled variables (recoding, grouping, missing values, etc); also has some useful tabulation functions - the sjPlot package contains functions for graphing and tabulating results from regression models\nPackages are often available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or private repositories such as Bioconductor, GitHub etc. Packages made available on CRAN can be installed using the command install.packages(\"packagename\"). Once the package/library is installed (i.e. it is sitting somewhere on your computer), we then need to load it to the current R session using the command library(packagename).\nSo using a package/library is a two-stage process. We:\n\n\nInstall the package/library onto your computer (from the internet)\n\nLoad the package/library into your current session using the library command.\n\nLet’s start by installing the ‘tidyverse’ package, and then load it:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")  ## this command installs packages from CRAN; note the quotation marks around the package name\n\nYou can check the suite of packages that are loaded when you load the Tidyverse library using a command from the tidyverse itself:\n\ntidyverse_packages()\n\n\nQuestion\nWhy do you think we got an error message when we tried to run the above command?\n\nBecause tidyverse_packages() is itself a function from the tidyverse, in order to use that function we need not only to install the tidyverse but also to make its functions available. In other words, we did not yet load the tidyverse for use in our R session, we only just installed it on our computers.\nIf we don’t want to load a package that we have downloaded - because maybe we only want to use a single function once and we don’t want to burden our computer’s memory, we can state explicitly which package the function is from in the following way:\n\ntidyverse::tidyverse_packages()  # Here we state the package followed by two colons, then followed by the function we want\n\nBut in many cases we do want to use several functions at various points in an analysis session, so it is usually useful to load the entire package or set of packages:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nNow we can use functions from that package without having to explicitly state the name of the package. We can still state the name explicitly, and that may be useful for readers of our code to understand what package a function come from. Also, it may happen that different packages have similarly named functions, and if all those packages are loaded, then the functions from a package loaded later will override that in the package loaded earlier. R will note in a comment whether any functions from a package are masked by another, so it’s worth paying attention to the comments and warnings printed by R when we load packages.\nThere are also convenience tools - e.g. the pacman package - that make it easier to load several packages at once, while at the same time downloading the package if it has not yet been downloaded on our computer.\nFor example, we can download a number of packages with the command below:\n\n# Install 'pacman' if not yet installed:\n\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\") \n\n# Then load/install other packages using 'pacman':\n\npacman::p_load(\n  tidyverse,    # general data management tools ('dplyr', etc.)\n  sjlabelled,   # data import from other software (alternative to 'haven') and labels management\n  sjmisc        # data transformation on variables (recoding,grouping, missing values, etc)\n  )"

    "section": "About the Tidyverse\n",
    "text": "About the Tidyverse\n\nData frames and ‘tibbles’\nThe Tidyverse is built around the basic concept that data in a table should have one observation per row, one variable per column, and only one value per cell. Once data is in this ‘tidy’ format, it can be transformed, visualized and modelled for an analysis.\nWhen using functions in the Tidyverse ecosystem, most data is returned as a tibble object. Tibbles are very similar to the data.frames (which are the basic types of object storing datasets in base R) and it is perfectly fine to use Tidyverse functions on a data.frame object. Just be aware that in most cases, the Tidyverse function will transform your data into a tibble. If you are unobservant, you won’t even notice a difference. However, there are a few differences between the two data types, most of which are just designed to make your life easier. For more info, check R4DS.\nSelected dplyr functions\nThe dplyr package is designed to make it easier to manipulate flat (2-D) data (i.e. the type of datasets we are most likely to use, which are laid out as in a standard spreadsheet, with rows referring to cases (observations; respondents) and columns referring to variables. dplyr provides simple “verbs”, functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate your thoughts into code. Here are some of the most common functions in dplyr:\n\n\nfilter() chooses rows based on column values.\n\narrange() changes the order of the rows.\n\nselect() changes whether or not a column is included.\n\nrename() changes the name of columns.\n\nmutate()/transmute() changes the values of columns and creates new columns (variables)\n\nsummarise() compute statistical summaries (e.g., computing the mean or the sum)\n\ngroup_by() group data into rows with the same values\n\nungroup() remove grouping information from data frame.\n\ndistinct() remove duplicate rows.\n\nAll these functions work similarly as follows:\n\nThe first argument is a data frame/tibble\nThe subsequent arguments are comma separated list of unquoted variable names and the specification of what you want to do\nThe result is a new data frame\n\nFor more info, check R for Social Scientists\nThe forward-pipe (%>%/|>) workflow\nAll of the dplyr functions take a data frame or tibble as the first argument. Rather than forcing the user to either save intermediate objects or nest functions, dplyr provides the forward-pipe operator %>% from the magrittr package. This operator allows us to combine multiple operations into a single sequential chain of actions. As of R 4.1.0 there is also a native pipe operator in R (|>), and in RStudio one can set the shortcut to paste the new pipe operator instead (as we have done at the beginning of the lab). Going forward, we’ll use this version of the pipe operator for simplicity, but it’s likely that you will encounter the older version of the operator too in various scripts.\nLet’s start with a hypothetical example. Say you would like to perform a sequence of operations on data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h():\n\nTake x then\n\nUse x as an input to a function f() then\n\nUse the output of f(x) as an input to a function g() then\n\nUse the output of g(f(x)) as an input to a function h()\n\nOne way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows:\nh(g(f(x)))\nThis code isn’t so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: f(), then g(), then h() and each of the functions is short in its name. Further, each of these functions also only has one argument. However, you can imagine that this will get progressively harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases and the arguments in each function increase as well. This is where the pipe operator |> comes in handy. |> takes the output of one function and then “pipes” it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read |> as “then” or “and then.” For example, you can obtain the same output as the hypothetical sequence of functions as follows:\nx |> \n  f() |> \n  g() |> \n  h()\nYou would read this sequence as:\n\nTake x then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function f() then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function g() then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function h()\n\nSo while both approaches achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can clearly read the sequence of operations line-by-line. Instead of typing out the three strange characters of the operator, one can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + M (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + M (MacOS) to paste the operator."

    "text": "Task 4: Data frame operations in a Quarto document\nIn this task, let’s start using the other document we created, the .qmd file. This file format allows you to combine both longer written text (such as detailed descriptions of your data analysis process or the main body of a report or journal article) with code chunks. To get you started using this file format, read Chapter 3.2. in TSD. Below we will focus only on the code chunks.\nCompared to what you have done in the R script, in the main Quarto document a # refers to a heading level rather than a comment. If you want to include a code chunk, you can click on the +C tab in the upper-right corner of the .qmd document’s toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+i. In the code chunk you would write in the same way as you did in the R script (they are basically mini-scripts). Within a code-chunk, therefore, the # still refers to a comment.\nTo execute a command withing a code chunk, you can either run each line/selection separately using Ctrl+Enter as in the R script, or you can run the entire content of the chunk with the green right-pointing triangle-arrow in the upper-right corner of the chunk.\nLet’s continue doing some operations on the mtcars dataset we looked at earlier, this time using some useful tidyverse functions.\nLet’s subset the data frame by selecting certain rows or columns. In tidyverse, you can do this with the filter() function for selecting rows and the select() function for selecting columns. Here we pipe the selections into head() to show the first few rows.

For example, the command head(mtcars) would print out the first 5 rows (cases) in the “mtcars” dataset included in base R (more specifically, in its “datasets” package):\n\nhead(mtcars)\n\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe data() function lists all the built-in packages. You can further specify package = to list datasets included in a given package; e.g.:\n\ndata(package = \"dplyr\")\n\n# Note that {dplyr} is one of the data management packages included in the core {tidyverse}. Make sure the {tidyverse} is installed.\n\n\n\nWe can also import built-in datasets to our Environment in order to inspect them manually:\n\nmtcars_data <- mtcars\n\nIf we want to access a dataset from a non-base-R package, we need to ensure that the package is installed on our system and that we specify the name of the package; e.g.:\n\nhead(starwars) # gives an Error\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 14\n  name         height  mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex   gender homew…⁵\n  <chr>         <int> <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl> <chr> <chr>  <chr>  \n1 Luke Skywal…    172    77 blond   fair    blue       19   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n2 C-3PO           167    75 <NA>    gold    yellow    112   none  mascu… Tatooi…\n3 R2-D2            96    32 <NA>    white,… red        33   none  mascu… Naboo  \n4 Darth Vader     202   136 none    white   yellow     41.9 male  mascu… Tatooi…\n5 Leia Organa     150    49 brown   light   brown      19   fema… femin… Aldera…\n6 Owen Lars       178   120 brown,… light   blue       52   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n# … with 4 more variables: species <chr>, films <list>, vehicles <list>,\n#   starships <list>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color,\n#   ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld\n\nhead(dplyr::starwars)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 14\n  name         height  mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex   gender homew…⁵\n  <chr>         <int> <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl> <chr> <chr>  <chr>  \n1 Luke Skywal…    172    77 blond   fair    blue       19   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n2 C-3PO           167    75 <NA>    gold    yellow    112   none  mascu… Tatooi…\n3 R2-D2            96    32 <NA>    white,… red        33   none  mascu… Naboo  \n4 Darth Vader     202   136 none    white   yellow     41.9 male  mascu… Tatooi…\n5 Leia Organa     150    49 brown   light   brown      19   fema… femin… Aldera…\n6 Owen Lars       178   120 brown,… light   blue       52   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n# … with 4 more variables: species <chr>, films <list>, vehicles <list>,\n#   starships <list>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color,\n#   ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld\n\n  # works, as long as {dplyr} or the whole {tidyverse} are installed\n\nReal-life datasets, however, need to be imported into R. Datasets come in various formats. R’s native data format has the extension .rds and can be imported with the readRDS() function. The counterpart function saveRDS() exports a dataset to the .rds format. The core-tidyverse {readr} package has similar functions (read_rds() / write_rds()).\nThe .rds format is useful because it can be compressed to various sizes to take up less space, but can only be directly opened in R. It is much more common to encounter data saved in a “delimited” text format, which can be easily opened in a spreadsheet viewer/editor such as Excel. This makes it very interchangeable and therefore very common. The most common is probably the “comma separated values” (.csv) format, which can be imported with the base-R function read.csv() or the tidyverse readr::read_csv() equivalent. Read Chapter 11 in R4DS for more on these functions.\nVery often, you will need to import data saved in the format of another proprietary statistical analysis package such as SPSS or Stata. Large survey projects usually make data available in these formats. The great advantage of these formats is that they can incorporate additional information about variables and the levels of categorical variables (e.g. value labels, specific values for different types of missing values). These additional information can be extremely valuable, but they are not handled straight-forwardly in text-based format, spreadsheets and R’s native data format. To make them operational in R, we need a few specially designed functions.\nThe {haven} package — part of the extended {tidyverse}, meaning that it is installed on your system as part of {tidyverse}, but the library(\"tidyverse\") command does not load it by default; it needs to be loaded explicitly — is one of the most commonly used for this purpose. Functions such as read_sas(), read_sav() and read_dta() import datasets specific to the SAS, SPSS and Stata programs, respectively.\nIt is highly recommended to read the documentation available for the {haven} package to understand how it operates. Fundamentally, it is designed to import data to a intermediary format which stores the additional labeling information in a special format that allows users to access them, but not making them easy to use directly. A suite of packages developed by Daniel Lüdecke from the University of Hamburg offer some additional functionality to work with labels directly when summarising and plotting data. These packages integrate well with the {tidyverse} and are actively maintained, and we will use them in this course to make our lives a bit easier. To install them, run:\n\n# We can install several packages at once by first creating a vector of their names\n\nsj_packages <- c(\"sjlabelled\", \"sjPlot\", \"sjstats\", \"ggeffects\", \"sjmisc\")\n\ninstall.packages(sj_packages)\n\nThe functions sjlabelled::read_sas(), sjlabelled::read_spss() and sjlabelled::read_stata() are the {sjlabelled} equivalents of the {haven} functions mentioned above. This vignette article included with the package explains the main differences between the two.\nAs a first step, let’s import the osterman dataset that underpins the Österman (2021) article (see the Data page on the course website for information about the datasets available in this course):\n\nosterman <- sjlabelled::read_stata(\"https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005-data/osterman.dta\")\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing functions learnt in Week 1, do the following:\n\ncheck the dimensions of the dataset; what does it tell you?\nprint a summary of the entire dataset; what have you learnt about the data?\n\n\nA very convenient way to create a codeplan for a dataset – especially if it has value-labelled categorical variables – is offered by the sjPlot::view_df() function, which produces a tables in HTML format that can be saved and consulted to get more information about the variables. With the default settings, we get the following:\n\nsjPlot::view_df(osterman)\n\nThe output opens up in the Viewer pane.\nThere are several additional options that can add useful complexity to the codeplan, as well as the option to restrict it to selected variables. It also works in a “piped” workflow, so it can be combined with {dplyr} verbs such as select to restrict variables beforehand in a more flexible way. Below we request a codeplan with extended options:\n\nsjPlot::view_df(osterman,\n                show.na = TRUE, \n                show.type = TRUE, \n                show.frq = TRUE, \n                show.prc = TRUE, \n                show.string.values = TRUE)\n\nThe output can also be opened in an external web browser window by clicking on the third (last) icon at the top of the Viewer toolbar. From the browser window, with a Ctrl + Right-click > Save as... we can save the table as an HTML document locally and use it as a reference.\n\nBefore moving forward, spend some time examining the codeplan that you have produced and if you haven’t yet had a chance to skim through the Österman (2021) article, have a quick read through their description of the dataset."

    "text": "SOLUTIONS\nExercise 1: Create some basic descriptive graphs using the ggplot() command from the {ggplot2} tidyverse package for the associaton between the following variables:\n\n‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’\n\nThe best way to approach this problem is by working through the first examples in Kieran Healy’s Data Visualization: A practical introduction, starting at Chapter 3, and applying them to your data. Outside class, you can develop these basic graphs into better looking ones by adding various extra layers. The ggplot() function is part of the ggplot2 package, which is included in the core tidyverse, so we don’t need to load it separately if we have already loaded the tidyverse.\nThe ggplot approach to graphs is to build them up step-by-step using various layers. The basic template code for a ggplot() graph is the following:\nggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()\nFor example, the code below sets up a totally blank canvas:\n\nggplot()\n\n\n\n\nTo start populating the canvas we need to add a first layer containing our dataset and the variables we want to ‘map’ using the aes() argument (for “aesthetic mapping”). This adds coordinates to the canvas based on the variables we want to graph (in our case, ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’). We are treating ‘trustindex3’ as the outcome variables in these exercises, so we will want to position it on the y axis:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25))\n\n\n\n\nWe now have a basic layer, but no actual data. The final crucial move is to add another layer using the + operator the type of graph (called a “geom” in ggplot, short for “geometric object”, such as a bar, a line, a boxplot, histogram, etc.) that we want to use to represent the relationship between the two variables. In this case, given that both variables are measured on a numeric scale (or at least on an ordinal scale with seven or more categories), the best option is a scatterplot. In ggplot(), a scatterplot “geom” are called with the geom_point() function:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nWe now have a scatterplot of the relationship between ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’. Because our scales are rather short and the data is spread out, this scatterplot is not very informative.\nWe can choose to add another “geom” that is better able to summarise the relationship. The function geom_jitter() (a shortcut to the specification geom_point(position = \"jitter\")) is helpful in such cases because it adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, making areas of overlapping points more visible. The commands below do the same thing:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\")\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_jitter()\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter()\n\n\n\n\nAnother option is the geom_smooth() function, which provides a set of options, basically returning “smooth lines” representing various types of regression lines. The function fits a regression in the background and graphs the results. The default setting is to fit a generalized additive model that captures non-linearities in the data with a smoothing spline (the Wikipedia article on GAMs gives a maths-heavy outline of these models, but they are beyond our interests here). The smooth line produced is probably more informative about the general idea:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\nBut we can also specify other regression methods, and because we are here aiming to model the relationship between trust and education as a linear model, we can specify the method as “lm”:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\nNow we get a straight regression line, which is basically the visual representation of the bivariate linear regression model that we will fit in Exercise 2 below. There are numerous further specifications that can be added to improve the graph, and Healy’s book is a good resource for ideas that you can play around with. We won’t go into much more detail about these additional options here, but as a taster, let’s say that we want to make the regression line more pronounced by changing its colour to red and make the scatter dots slightly transparent by adjusting the colour’s “alpha” level:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’\n\nWe can now do something similar for the relationship between trust and age (the ‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’ variables in the dataset). Again, both variables are measured on a numeric scale, so a scatterplot should work best. Because we don’t know what to expect and therefore what additional settings would improve each individual graph, we start from the most basic informative layer and build up from there. To practice some alternative approaches to working with plots, here we will first save the basic plot as a ggplot object, to which we can later add further layers and specifications:\n\nage_plot <- ggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = agea)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nIf no output was generated from the command above, that’s as expected. The graph was produced, but we didn’t ask for it to be printed, we only asked for it to be saved as an object called “age_plot”. To see it, we can simply call “age_plot”. We can then make various additions to this plot.\n\nage_plot\n\n\n\n\nThis looks very similar to the previous graph, so we could add the same additional specificaitons as in the previous exercise, this time to the plot object that we saved:\n\nage_plot +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nThe association between age and trust appears very weak, something that we will explore further in Exercise 2.\n\n‘trustindex3’ and ‘female’\n\nWe can try a similar scatterplot here too, but there may be better options:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nThis graph can be confusing, are we are better off using another “geom” because the female variable is a dichotomous/binary factor (categorical) variable. A good visualisation tool in the this case is a boxplot, which can be called with the geom_boxplot() function. There will be a challenge, though:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nThe issue with this graph is that the female variable is recognised as numeric by R. What we need to do first - or, as part of the ggplot() function itself - is to tell R to treat *female as a factor. We could do the following:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = factor(female))) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nOr as part of a piped workflow:\n\nosterman |> mutate(female = as_factor(female)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nBut it may be useful to change the variable type in the dataset altogether by saving the mutation and then using the changed female variable:\n\n# We are overwriting the original dataset here, so we better not make a mistake:\nosterman <- osterman |> mutate(female = as_factor(female))\n\n# And from now on the 'female' variable will be treated as a factor:\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: What factors affect trust?\nFit three simple bivariate OLS regressions using the lm() function:\n\nRegress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘eduyrs25’ and interpret the results\n\nWe will do just that, saving the regression as an object called “m1” (for model 1):\n\nm1 <- lm(trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25, data = osterman)\n\nThe model object has now been saved in the Environment, and we can inspect it manually if we want by opening it in the Source window. The object is a large list, with various components that we can call and print separately. The most basic information that we can obtain from the model is the coefficients:\n\ncoefficients(m1)\n\n(Intercept)    eduyrs25 \n  3.9085904   0.1054227 \n\n\nThis basic information is enough to solve the linear equation underpinning the model:\n\\[ y_i=b_0+b_1x_i \\] The coefficients correspond to the \\(b\\)’s in this simple model, and we can plug the values in to obtain\n\\[ trust_i=3.91 + 0.11 \\times education_i \\]\nWe find, thus, that the number of years spent in education has a positive outcome on social trust, with each additional year of education associated with a 0.11-points higher score on the trust index, above the baseline of 3.91 points in the case when education is equal to 0. With this formula we can calculate predictions of the trust score for any individual \\(i\\) from their years of education.\nWe can also get more information about the model with the summary() function. When applied to a linear model object, it provides the following output:\n\nsummary(m1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25, data = osterman)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-6.5442 -1.1737  0.1426  1.2992  6.0914 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept) 3.908590   0.022630   172.7   <2e-16 ***\neduyrs25    0.105423   0.001692    62.3   <2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 1.853 on 68209 degrees of freedom\n  (585 observations deleted due to missingness)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.05384,   Adjusted R-squared:  0.05383 \nF-statistic:  3882 on 1 and 68209 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\n\nThis output tells us a lot more about the fitted model, for example a summary table of the residuals and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) summary of the residuals, as well as estimates of variation for our coefficients (the standard errors and the p-values associated with t-tests - displayed as Pr(>|t|)).\nWhile these are informative, the format is not ideal for further manipulation and presentation. Several user-written functions exist to improve on this output. For example, the {broom} package - part of the {tidymodels} suite of packages - has functions to extract model information into “tidy” tibbles (data sets), which can then be further manipulated and plotted. This is especially useful when working with results from many models that would benefit from comparing in a standardised format.\nThe {sjPlot} package that we used before also has functions to export a publishable-quality table in HTML format:\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(m1)\n\n\n\n\n \ntrustindex 3\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n3.91\n3.86 – 3.95\n<0.001\n\n\neduyrs25\n0.11\n0.10 – 0.11\n<0.001\n\n\nObservations\n68211\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.054 / 0.054\n\n\n\n\nBy default the output table shows 95% confidence intervals (CI) instead of standard errors (SE), which can be easier to interpret (CI are calculated as Estimate +/- (1.96 x Std. Error); you can try it out in the Console, replacing in the numeric values).\nThe best approach is to graph the model results and present them in a figure, but that’s not very informative in the case of a simple model with only one predictor, so we can leave it for later.\n\nRegress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘agea’ and interpret the results\n\nWe can do as above:\n\nm2 <- lm(trustindex3 ~ agea, data = osterman)\n\nsummary(m2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = trustindex3 ~ agea, data = osterman)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-5.4185 -1.2439  0.1195  1.4047  4.9126 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

The impact of gender is still very weak in real terms: compared to men of similar age and education level, women score 0.04 points higher on the trust scale; but this is still a stronger effect than in the simple bivariate model (where \\(b_1\\) was 0.008), and our confidence intervals are much narrower.\nWe could tabulate these two models in a comparative table to better see the contrast:\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(m3, m4)\n\n\n\n\n \ntrustindex 3\ntrustindex 3\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n5.24\n5.22 – 5.26\n<0.001\n2.95\n2.87 – 3.04\n<0.001\n\n\nfemale: female 1\n0.01\n-0.02 – 0.04\n0.578\n0.04\n0.01 – 0.07\n0.004\n\n\neduyrs 25\n\n\n\n0.12\n0.11 – 0.12\n<0.001\n\n\nAge ofrespondent,calculated\n\n\n\n0.02\n0.01 – 0.02\n<0.001\n\n\nObservations\n68796\n68211\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.000 / -0.000\n0.063 / 0.063\n\n\n\n\nIt’s worth noticing that the number of observations used in the two models is not the same, due to missing values in some variables. We could make the samples comparable by selecting out the sample of 68,211 included in Model 4, then refitting Model 3 on that sample only:\n\nsample <- m4$model\n\nm3_new <- lm(trustindex3 ~ female, data = sample)\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(m3_new, m4)\n\n\n\n\n \ntrustindex 3\ntrustindex 3\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n5.24\n5.22 – 5.26\n<0.001\n2.95\n2.87 – 3.04\n<0.001\n\n\nfemale: female 1\n0.01\n-0.02 – 0.04\n0.582\n0.04\n0.01 – 0.07\n0.004\n\n\neduyrs 25\n\n\n\n0.12\n0.11 – 0.12\n<0.001\n\n\nAge ofrespondent,calculated\n\n\n\n0.02\n0.01 – 0.02\n<0.001\n\n\nObservations\n68211\n68211\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.000 / -0.000\n0.063 / 0.063\n\n\n\n\nWe see that this does not affect the overall picture.\n(Advanced) Exercise 3: Apply the model to a new dataset\nThe ostermann data originates from Waves 1-9 of the European Social Survey. The ESS data are accessible freely upon registration. As part of this exercise, access data from Wave 10 of the survey (from this site: https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/) and perform the following tasks:\n\ndownload the dataset to the Rproject folder\nselect the variables required to recreate the data to fit the multiple regression model from the previous exercise\ncreate your version of the ‘trustindex3’ variable\nfit the models from Exercise 2 and compare the results.\n\nYou should already be familiar with the functions needed to complete each of these steps, but it may require some self-study. The most important missing information required to compete this task is to be found in the description on how the trustindex3 scale was computed provided by Osterman:\n\nTo study generalized social trust, I am following the established approach of using a validated three-item scale (Reeskens and Hooghe 2008; Zmerli and Newton 2008). This scale consists of the classic trust question, an item on whether people try to be fair, and an item on whether people are helpful:  - ‘Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?’  - ‘Do you think that most people would try to take advantage of you if they got the chance, or would they try to be fair?’  - ‘Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or that they are mostly looking out for themselves?’  All of the items may be answered on a scale from 0 to 10 (where 10 represents the highest level of trust) and the scale is calculated as the mean of the three items. The three-item scale clearly improves measurement reliability and cross-country validity compared to using a single item, such as the classic trust question. Internal consistency for the three items is reasonably high (Cronbach’s alpha: 0.77). The scale ranges between 0 and 10 with a mean of 5.24 for my sample. See the Supplementary material for additional information on the construction of the social trust scale (Section A.1), as well as for models using the classic single-item measure of trust (Section A.9).\n\n\n<< the end >>"

    "text": "Basic interactions\nTo continue on from the toy models that we fitted in Week 2, we may remember that we observed a change in the size of the effect and statistical significance of the gender variable (female) when also accounting for years of education and age.

In other words, we may have reasons to assume that the linear effect of education may be different for males and females. We can interact predictor variables in regression models using the : and * operators. With :, we include in the regression model only the interaction term, but not the component variables (i.e. their main effects); to include the component variables as well, we need to add them in as usual with the + operator. To note that we should normally want to include both main effects and and the interaction effects in a regression model. With *, we include both the main effects and the interaction effects, so it provides a shortcut to using :, but it is often useful to combine the two in more complex interaction scenarios.\nIn the code below, we interact gender with both education and age, and the two commands have the same result:\n\nmxa <- lm(trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25 + agea +female + female*eduyrs25 + female*agea, data = osterman)\n\nmxb <- lm(trustindex3 ~ female*(eduyrs25 + agea), data = osterman)\n\n## Check that they are equivalent\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(mxa, mxb)\n\n\n\n\n \ntrustindex 3\ntrustindex 3\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n3.25\n3.13 – 3.36\n<0.001\n3.25\n3.13 – 3.36\n<0.001\n\n\neduyrs 25\n0.10\n0.10 – 0.11\n<0.001\n0.10\n0.10 – 0.11\n<0.001\n\n\nAge ofrespondent,calculated\n0.01\n0.01 – 0.02\n<0.001\n0.01\n0.01 – 0.02\n<0.001\n\n\nfemale\n-0.53\n-0.69 – -0.36\n<0.001\n-0.53\n-0.69 – -0.36\n<0.001\n\n\neduyrs25:female\n0.03\n0.02 – 0.03\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\n\nagea:female\n0.00\n0.00 – 0.01\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\n\nfemale:eduyrs25\n\n\n\n0.03\n0.02 – 0.03\n<0.001\n\n\nfemale:agea\n\n\n\n0.00\n0.00 – 0.01\n<0.001\n\n\nObservations\n68211\n68211\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.064 / 0.064\n0.064 / 0.064\n\n\n\n\nWe find that both interaction terms (eduyrs25:female and agea:female) are statistically significant, which can tell us that there is an interaction that may be useful to include in the model. The greatest challenge is in interpreting results from interaction models, as the usual interpretation of the main effect terms no longer stands and the focus should be on the interaction terms instead. The best approach is to visualise the interactions using a graph, and there are various user-written functions that make this task easy. Just to keep it simple, we will use the plot_model() function from the {sjPlot} package.\nFirst, we can check the interaction between education and gender:\n\nsjPlot::plot_model(mxa, type = \"pred\", terms = c(\"eduyrs25\", \"female\"))\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization in now easier to interpret than the numerical output. We see a steeper line for females than for males and the lines cross each other at around 12 years of completed schooling. Years spent in education therefore have a stronger influence on social trust for females than for males after around 12 years (which is generally the length of compulsory education in most European countries from which the data is drawn). Among those with education below this level, we find that males have higher levels of social trust, but longer educational careers have a stronger impact for women.\nWe can check the same for the interaction of gender and age:\n\nsjPlot::plot_model(mxa, type = \"pred\", terms = c(\"agea\", \"female\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe general pattern is the same, however, the overlapping confidence intervals up until about the age of 53 tell us that the observed difference between the two genders may be due to random variation in our sample. The effect of this interaction is weaker and less reliable than the one with education, and unless we have a strong theoretically motivated reason to include it in our model, we may want to keep a simpler model without this interaction effect."

David, however, thought that this does not stand true also for scientists’ and statisticians’ own emerging interest in their disciplines. He was right, in that the critical examination of the intellectual development of statistics and probability theory that followed has improved the discipline by excavating ideas that had been buried by mainstream statistics, but he was also mistaken, in that this activity threw light on the decadence of mainstream statistical practice. In this lecture we will look back on the development of some basic statistical concepts and learn about the ideas and preoccupations that influenced them over the centuries. The aim of this overview is to build up essential intuition about the concepts and methods that we will learn later. Brains-on activities will include casting astragali, fighting Laplace’s Demon, tasting tea, and comparing peas in a pod. By the end, we will gain a clearer understanding of the limits of statistical analysis and the dangers of not acknowledging those limits.\nThe IT lab will provide a very hands-on practical introduction to the statistical software that will be used in the module.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2  Revisiting Flatland  A review of general linear models\n\n\nIn Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella, the inhabitants of Flatland are geometric shapes living in a two-dimensional world, incapable of imagining the existence of higher dimensions. A sphere passing through the plain of their world is a fascinating but incomprehensible event: Flatlanders can only see a dot becoming a circle, increasing in circumference, then shrinking back in size and disappearing. There are, in this universe, worlds with even more limited views, like the one-dimensional Lineland and the zero-dimensional Pointland. Any attempt to expand the perspective of their inhabitant(s) is doomed to failure. But as in any good adventure story, a chosen Flatland native embarks on a journey of discovery and revelation - and ostracism and imprisonment. The story is interpreted as an allegorical criticism of Victorian-age social structure, but can equally describe the limitations of inhabiting uncritically a methodological world in which all data are ‘normal’ and all relationships are linear. Moving beyond linearity and acquiring the statistical intuition needed to think in higher dimensions and perceive more complex relationships is indeed a matter of practice-induced revelation. It’s unlikely that we will reach statistical nirvana in this short course, but we’ll attempt to build some more substantial structures upon the arid plains of linear regression. We start by looking around in the Flat-, Line- and Point-lands of quantitative analysis. Incorrigible procrastinators may want to check out a full-length computer animated film version of Flatland on YouTube. Others may be better served by this brief TED-Ed animation.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3  Dear Prudence, Help! I may be cheating with my X  Interactions and the logic of causal inference\n\n\nMuch of what we do in quantitative data analysis is about examining relationships. We are often interested in proposing and testing models of relationships between two or more variables. Sometimes our variables cry out to us begging for help, and we turn into agony aunts and uncles to our data. Other times we must psychoanalyse our data to uncover hidden associations and interactions. This is not an easy task. Do it carelessly, and you may unwittingly cheat yourself and the readers of your research. This week we’ll build some intuition for detecting complex and uneasy relationships within the design matrix X - that promiscuous commune on the right-hand-side of our regression equations. We’ll expand on the linear additive models that we looked at in the previous week by considering interactions among our predictor variables, we’ll explore the possibilities and challenges of asking causal questions of observational data, and we’ll think about ways to avoid what evolutionary anthropologist Richard McElreath calls ‘causal salad’. We may get an uncomfortable feeling that we may have cheated with our Xs in the past, but we’ll look towards the future. By the way, Dear Prudence is Slate magazine’s advice column; I like the name because being prudent really is essential in data analysis and interpretation. If you’re done with the readings for this week, you may indulge in some Prudie advice on matters more serious than statistics.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4  The Y question  Generalised linear models\n\n\nIt wasn’t until the last quarter of the 20th century that a unified vision of statistical modelling emerged, allowing practitioners to see how the general linear model we have explored so far is only a specific case of a more general class of models. We could have had a fancy, memorable name for this class of models - as John Nelder, one of its inventors, acknowledged later in life (Senn 2003:127) - but back then academics were not required to undertake marketing training on the tweetabilty-factor of the chosen names for their theories; so we ended up with “generalised linear models”. These models can be applied to explananda (“explained”, “response”, “outcome”, “dependent” etc. variables, our ys) whose possible values have certain constraints (such as being limited by a lower bound or constrained to discreet choices) that makes the parameters of the Gaussian (‘normal’) distribution inefficient in describing them. Instead, they follow some of the other “exponential distributions” (and not only the exponential: cf. Gelman et al. (2020:264)), of which the Poisson, gamma, beta, binomial and multinomial are probably the most common in human and social sciences research. Their “generalised linear modelling” involves mapping them unto a linear model using a so-called “link function”. We will explore what all of this means in practice and how it can be applied to data that we are interested in most in our respective fields of study.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5  Do we live in a simulation?  Basic data simulation for statistical inference and power analysis\n\n\nWe have known ever since science-fiction author Philip K. Dick’s memorable “Metz address” of 1977 that our world is a computer simulation. Of course, like some common-currency theories in the social sciences, this knowledge will never be truly verified. We won’t even attempt to get to the bottom of it in class; instead, we’ll practice some basic methods of computer simulation for statistical inference and for generating data that has some idealised characteristics. Such methods play an increasingly important role in computational statistics and are extremely useful for designing robust data collection and analysis plans. If you make a mistake in the code and end up in an infinite loop, but you’re afraid that stopping the process may cause the known universe to implode, you can watch Dick on YouTube while you wait. If something like this can happen to our data, who says it couldn’t happen to us?\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6  Challenging hierarchies  Multilevel models\n\n\nBy now we got a sense that every new thing we learn about turns out to be merely a specific case of a larger class of things. So, all the models we covered so far are specific, single-level, versions of multilevel models, in which our cases can be seen as clustered within larger entities. Sometimes they are part of several cross-cutting clusters and/or the clusters are themselves clustered. In general terms, we must acknowledge that there are dependencies in our data that may influence their behaviour. It turns out that data about humans living in societies look somewhat like humans living in societies. The importance of including information about hierarchical dependencies in our models is probably emphasised by no one else more than McElreath (2020:15), who wants “to convince the reader of something that appears unreasonable: multilevel regression deserves to be the default form of regression. Papers that do not use multilevel models should have to justify not using a multilevel approach.” We will encounter some of the uses and challenges of multilevel modelling.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7  The unobserved  Latent variables and structural models\n\n\nThe unobserved sounds like the title of a promising horror film; if we have achieved our aims in the module so far, our horror should be ‘merely’ metaphysical by now (Kołakowski anyone? No? Okay, never mind). We have already had to deal with various aspects of latency in our analyses. At the most fundamental level, we speak about population parameters, but we never actually observe them; even a sample statistic can be a purely imaginary case that doesn’t occur in real life. We have discussed the effects of omitted variables, which are thus unobserved by our model, but which we may have access to in our data. And, of course, our most interesting measurements are likely to be proxies of some unobservable theoretical construct (Mulvin (2021) has recently published a wonderfully rich book about proxies in general). This week we pick up an earlier thread from week 4, where we thought about binary and ordered multinomial variables as discretised manifestations of some continuous ‘latent variable’. We expand on this idea by exploring simple and then more complex latent variable models (factor analysis, structural equation modelling), as a further generalisation of the hierarchical perspective introduced earlier. This gives us a few more tools to deal with our radical uncertainty. (n.b. missing data points are another challenge that could fall under this heading, and learning how to deal with them is extremely important; but “The missing” is too good a title not to deserve a high-budget, weak-storyline, full-on special effects sequel somewhere else)\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8  Words, words, mere words…  Text as data\n\n\nAs researchers in humanities and the social sciences, we use words both as tools of analysis and as sources of data. Words, and more broadly, texts, are also increasingly important for quantitative research in an age of so-called ‘big data’, when the digital world is saturated with unstructured textual information. But the statistical inspection of text is neither new, nor restricted to the humanistic tail of the social sciences. For example, a documented interest in the statistical study of literary style for the purposes of attributing authorship dates back to the mid-1850s (see El-Shagi and Jung 2015); and investors can use textual data such as minutes from the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee’s deliberations to estimate future monetary policy decisions before they are actually taken (cf. Lord 1958). Methods for the collection and quantitative analysis of large-scale textual data are increasingly available, but their technical implementation is complex and requires efficient combination of humanistic subject knowledge and statistical expertise. Faced with words, one is understandably caught between Shakespeare’s Troilus and Wilde’s Dorian Gray. “Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart; th’ effect doth operate another way. … My love with words and errors still she feeds, but edifies another with her deeds” - believed the betrayed Troilus. “Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?” - pondered Dorian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDavid, F. N. 1955. “Studies in the History of Probability and Statistics i.

Regression and other stories. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ROS\n\n\nFree to download PDF version from the book’s website: https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexander, Rohan. 2023. Telling Stories with Data. Chapman and Hall/CRC  TSD\n\n\nFree online book: https://tellingstorieswithdata.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, A., and Hill, J. 2007. Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ARM\n\n\nNote: ROS is the expanded and updated version of Part 1 (and some of Part 3) of this book. While everyone in the free world eagerly awaits the publication of ROS’s multilevel counterpart, we’ll use ARM as a reference work for the theory underpinning multilevel modelling.  Not freely available. Access it in print or online via the NU library\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatively large portions of text will be assigned for reading in each week from these books, referring to them by their acronyms. Don’t worry if you cannot read all the textbook content assigned in any given week! Those for whom the method covered by the assigned readings is new, will be able to refer back to them throughout the semester and beyond, reading thoroughly and completing the applied exercises. Those already familiar to some extent with the methods, should nonetheless read the text as a narrative and will discover hidden gems that will spectacularly improve their understanding and ability to interpret their statistical results.\n\n\nApplication\nIn the IT labs we will practice applying methods by reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. To fully understand the context of these data and the methods used, you must read the original journal articles and the available supplementary materials provided alongside. These readings will be listed under each week’s outline (still work in progress!).\nThe articles come from a variety of different fields, so expect them to push you outside your disciplinary comfort zone. The point is to see how methods have been used in practice and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable you to apply this knowledge to your own research questions.\nWhen selecting the articles, the aim was to strike a fine balance between (a) the simplicity of the methods employed, (b) data and analytical transparency, and (c) the strength of the analysis. So don’t take them as examples of all-rounds best practice, but examples of research that gets published while being self-confident enough to open itself up for public scrutiny. Aim for this in your own research!\n\n\nTechnique\nThere will also be various readings relating more closely to the technicalities of coding in R and scientific writing, collaboration and communication in general. These readings will also be listed under each week’s outline as the semester progresses. The generic reading that students are advised to go through on their own is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund. 2022. R for Data Science (2nd ed.)  R4DS\n\n\nFree online book: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition\nFinally, there will also be recommended readings listed under certain weeks that help place methods, statistics and probability theory in a broader frame. These are useful readings for everyone, regardless of whether you will be applying quantitative analysis in your research or future work.\n\n\n\n\nRequired software\nWe will use a number of open-source software for data analysis and scientific writing. You need to install these on your personal computers to be able to work away from campus:\n\n\n\n\nR\n(programming language)\nEssential\nR needs to be installed even if we will only use it via the RStudio interface.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nRStudio\n(integrated development environment)\nEssential\nYou will need the free desktop version appropriate for your operating system. RStudio combines the R Console - the direct interface to R - with a number of other panels.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nTidyverse\n(collection of R packages)\nEssential\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages that make the R language easier to use by introducing a more consistent grammar. It provides functions that are particularly useful for data manipulation and visualisation. It is the most common ‘dialect’ used among social scientists.\nInstall from within RStudio by executing in the Console:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\nQuarto\n(scientific publishing system)\nEssential\nWe will be using Quarto markdown documents (.qmd) throughout the course to document our data analysis. .qmd files extend the plain-text Markdown mark-up language (.md) to allow for data analysis code to be executed and results presented alongside the main text. This is an essential requirement for analytical transparency, reliability and reproducibility.The assignment will also be completed in .qmd.\nIncluded by default in the latest RStudio release; no need to install separately.\nYou can check your installation by executing in the RStudio Terminal :\nquarto check\n\n\n\nZotero\n(reference manager)\nRecommended\nIf you are not yet using a reference manager, I recommend giving Zotero a try. It will make your work much more efficient and it integrates (relatively well) with RMarkdown and Quarto using the the Better BibTeX add-on.\nInstall the latest version and add-ons from here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with no previous experience using R and/or RStudio are advised to complete the self-paced free online training course R for Social Scientists provided by Data Carpentry at https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to get help with R outside class. If you encounter an error message or are looking for a function to perform a specific task that we have not covered in class, you can do a Google search; for best results, use the https://rseek.org/ search engine, which limits the results to those relating to the R language.\nYou can also search for answers on Stack Overflow, which is a popular help and discussion website for programmers. You can also post a question there, but make sure to follow community standards and advice on how to ask a good question and how to provide a minimal reproducible example. You will need some experience using the site before being able to ask a good question, but it’s more than certain that any quesiton you have at this stage will have an answer already somewhere.\n\n\nAny further study resources will be listed here."

It is an umbrella term that encompasses many other models, which allows the response variable y to have an error distribution other than a normal distribution. The models include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Poisson Regression.\nIn a Linear Regression Model, the response (aka dependent/target) variable ‘y’ is expressed as a linear function/linear combination of all the predictors ‘X’ (aka independent/regression/explanatory/observed variables). The underlying relationship between the response and the predictors is linear (i.e. we can simply visualize the relationship in the form of a straight line). Also, the error distribution of the response variable should be normally distributed. Therefore we are building a linear model.\nGLM models allow us to build a linear relationship between the response and predictors, even though their underlying relationship is not linear. This is made possible by using a link function, which links the response variable to a linear model. Unlike Linear Regression models, the error distribution of the response variable need not be normally distributed. The errors in the response variable are assumed to follow an exponential family of distribution (i.e. normal, binomial, Poisson, or gamma distributions). Since we are trying to generalize a linear regression model that can also be applied in these cases, the name Generalized Linear Models."
