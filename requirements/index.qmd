## Level/rereq

To benefit the most from this module, students are expected to have a foundational level of knowledge in quantitative methods. This roughly covers a good understanding of data types, some understanding of distributions, bivariate statistical tests and inferential statistics, and some familiarity with linear regression. Those who don't feel completely up to date with linear regression but are determined to advance more quickly and can commit to read and practice beyond the compulsory readings during weeks 1-3 are also encouraged to sign up. Those with a stronger background in multiple linear regression (e.g. students with undergraduate-level training in econometrics) will still benefit from weeks 1-3 as the approach we are taking is probably different from the one they are familiar with.
