If he threw well, particularly if he obtained the image of the goddess herself, no two showing the same number, he adored the goddess, and was in high hopes of gratifying his passion; if he threw badly, as usually happens, and got an unlucky combination, he called down imprecations on all Cnidos, and was as much overcome by grief as if he had suffered some personal loss.\n\n--- Lucian of Samosata (c. 125 – 180), writing in his trademark satirical style about a young man who fell in love with Praxiteles's Aphrodite of Knidos; cited in F.

Sometimes numbers were left off or duplicated; hollow dice have been found dating from Roman time\n- Dice were also *imperfect*; a \"fair\" die was the exception rather than the rule\n- Experiment by F.

You begin selecting pebbles from the urn and recording their colors, black or white. How do you use these results to make a guess about the ratio of pebble colors in the urn as a whole?\n\n- Bernoulli's solution: if you take a *large enough sample*, you can be very sure, to within a small margin of absolute certainty, that the proportion of white pebbles you observe in the sample is close to the proportion of white pebbles in the urn.\n- A first version of the *Law of Large Numbers*\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n![](./images/jbernouli.jpg){.absolute right=\"5%\" top=\"1%\" width=\"250\"}\n\n![](./images/ars_con.jpg){.absolute right=\"5%\" top=\"45%\" width=\"250\"}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n## Large numbers\n\n::: {.incremental}\n- Bernoulli's solution, more technically:\n<br>\nFor any given $\\epsilon$ > 0 and any $s$ > 0, there is a sample size $n$ such that, with $w$ being the number of white pebbles counted in the sample and $f$ being the true fraction of white pebbles in the urn, the probability of $w/n$ falling between $f − \\epsilon$ and $f + \\epsilon$ is greater than $1 − s$.\n\n- the fraction $w/n$ is the ratio of white to total pebbles we observe in our sample\n- $\\epsilon$ (epsilon) captures the fact that we may not see the true urn ratio exactly thanks to random variation in the sample; larger samples help assure that we get closer to the \"true\" value, but uncertainty always remains\n- $s$ reflects just how sure we want to be; for example, set $s$ = 0.01 and be 99% percent sure.\n- “moral certainty” as distinct from *absolute* certainty of the kind *logical deduction* provides\n:::",
