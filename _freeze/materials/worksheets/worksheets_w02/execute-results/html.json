You will be working with data from @Osterman2021CanWeTrustEducationFostering to replicate parts their analysis. We will be covering only basic regression methods in this session, so the article will serve mainly as a broad background to the data here. We will be returning to this article in future weeks too, expanding our modelling strategy as we discover new methods. We will also practice some data management tasks and the basics of data visualisation using principles from 'the **g**rammar of **g**raphics' as implemented in the [`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package (see Kieran Healy's [*Data Visualization: A practical introduction*](https://socviz.co/) for an introduction with many practical examples).\n\nBy the end of the session, you will:\n\n- learn how to import data from foreign formats (e.g. SPSS, Stata, CSV)\n- know how to perform basic descriptive statistics on a dataset\n- understand the basics of data visualisation\n- know how to fit linear regression models in `R` using different functions\n- learn a few options for presenting findings from regression models\n\n## Setup\n\nIn Week 1 you set up `R` and `RStudio`, and an **RProject** folder (we called it \"HSS8005_labs\") with an `.R` script and a `.qmd` or `.Rmd` document in it (we called these \"Lab_1\"). Ideally, you saved this on a cloud drive so you can access it from any computer (e.g. OneDrive). You will be working in this folder. If it's missing, complete [Task 2 from the Week 1 Lab](https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005/materials/worksheets/worksheets_w01.html#task-2-set-up-a-new-r-project-with-an-.r-script-and-a-.qmd-document-included).\n\nYou can create a new `.R` script and `.qmd`/`.Rmd` for this week's work (e.g. \"Lab_2\"). Start working in the `.R` script initially, then switch to `.qmd`/`.Rmd` later in the session to report on your final analysis.\n\n## Importing data\n\nAs we have seen in Week 1, small datasets that are included in R packages (including base R) for demonstration purposes can be used by simply invoking the name of the dataset. For example, the command `head(mtcars)` would print out the first 5 rows (cases) in the \"mtcars\" dataset included in base R (more specifically, in its \"datasets\" package):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(mtcars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nThe `data()` function lists all the built-in packages. You can further specify `package =` to list datasets included in a given package; e.g.:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(package = \"dplyr\")\n\n# Note that {dplyr} is one of the data management packages included in the core {tidyverse}. Make sure the {tidyverse} is installed.\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nWe can also import built-in datasets to our Environment in order to inspect them manually:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmtcars_data <- mtcars\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we want to access a dataset from a non-base-R package, we need to ensure that the package is installed on our system and that we specify the name of the package; e.g.:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(starwars) # gives an Error\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 14\n  name         height  mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex   gender homew…⁵\n  <chr>         <int> <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl> <chr> <chr>  <chr>  \n1 Luke Skywal…    172    77 blond   fair    blue       19   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n2 C-3PO           167    75 <NA>    gold    yellow    112   none  mascu… Tatooi…\n3 R2-D2            96    32 <NA>    white,… red        33   none  mascu… Naboo  \n4 Darth Vader     202   136 none    white   yellow     41.9 male  mascu… Tatooi…\n5 Leia Organa     150    49 brown   light   brown      19   fema… femin… Aldera…\n6 Owen Lars       178   120 brown,… light   blue       52   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n# … with 4 more variables: species <chr>, films <list>, vehicles <list>,\n#   starships <list>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color,\n#   ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(dplyr::starwars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 14\n  name         height  mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex   gender homew…⁵\n  <chr>         <int> <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl> <chr> <chr>  <chr>  \n1 Luke Skywal…    172    77 blond   fair    blue       19   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n2 C-3PO           167    75 <NA>    gold    yellow    112   none  mascu… Tatooi…\n3 R2-D2            96    32 <NA>    white,… red        33   none  mascu… Naboo  \n4 Darth Vader     202   136 none    white   yellow     41.9 male  mascu… Tatooi…\n5 Leia Organa     150    49 brown   light   brown      19   fema… femin… Aldera…\n6 Owen Lars       178   120 brown,… light   blue       52   male  mascu… Tatooi…\n# … with 4 more variables: species <chr>, films <list>, vehicles <list>,\n#   starships <list>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color,\n#   ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  # works, as long as {dplyr} or the whole {tidyverse} are installed\n```\n:::\n\n\nReal-life datasets, however, need to be imported into R. Datasets come in various formats. R's native data format has the extension `.rds` and can be imported with the `readRDS()` function. The counterpart function `saveRDS()` exports a dataset to the `.rds` format. The core-tidyverse [{readr}](https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html) package has similar functions (`read_rds()` / `write_rds()`).\n\nThe `.rds` format is useful because it can be compressed to various sizes to take up less space, but can only be directly opened in `R`. It is much more common to encounter data saved in a \"delimited\" text format, which can be easily opened in a spreadsheet viewer/editor such as Excel. This makes it very interchangeable and therefore very common. The most common is probably the \"comma separated values\" (`.csv`) format, which can be imported with the base-R function `read.csv()` or the tidyverse `readr::read_csv()` equivalent. Read Chapter 11 in [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html) for more on these functions.\n\nVery often, you will need to import data saved in the format of another proprietary statistical analysis package such as SPSS or Stata. Large survey projects usually make data available in these formats. The great advantage of these formats is that they can incorporate additional information about variables and the levels of categorical variables (e.g. value labels, specific values for different types of missing values). These additional information can be extremely valuable, but they are not handled straight-forwardly in text-based format, spreadsheets and R's native data format. To make them operational in R, we need a few specially designed functions.\n\nThe [{haven}](https://haven.tidyverse.org/index.html) package --- part of the extended {tidyverse}, meaning that it is installed on your system as part of {tidyverse}, but the `library(\"tidyverse\")` command does not load it by default; it needs to be loaded explicitly --- is one of the most commonly used for this purpose. Functions such as `read_sas()`, `read_sav()` and `read_dta()` import datasets specific to the SAS, SPSS and Stata programs, respectively.\n\nIt is highly recommended to read the documentation available for the [{haven}](https://haven.tidyverse.org/index.html) package to understand how it operates. Fundamentally, it is designed to import data to a intermediary format which stores the additional labeling information in a special format that allows users to access them, but not making them easy to use directly. A [suite of packages developed by Daniel Lüdecke](https://strengejacke.r-universe.dev/builds) from the University of Hamburg offer some additional functionality to work with labels directly when summarising and plotting data. These packages integrate well with the {tidyverse} and are actively maintained, and we will use them in this course to make our lives a bit easier. To install them, run:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# We can install several packages at once by first creating a vector of their names\n\nsj_packages <- c(\"sjlabelled\", \"sjPlot\", \"sjstats\", \"ggeffects\", \"sjmisc\")\n\ninstall.packages(sj_packages)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe functions `sjlabelled::read_sas()`, `sjlabelled::read_spss()` and `sjlabelled::read_stata()` are the {sjlabelled} equivalents of the {haven} functions mentioned above. [This vignette article](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjlabelled/articles/intro_sjlabelled.html) included with the package explains the main differences between the two.\n\nAs a first step, let's import the **osterman** dataset that underpins the @Osterman2021CanWeTrustEducationFostering article (see the [Data page](https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005/data/) on the course website for information about the datasets available in this course):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nosterman <- sjlabelled::read_stata(\"https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005-data/osterman.dta\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::{.task}\n\nUsing functions learnt in Week 1, do the following:\n\n1. check the dimensions of the dataset; what does it tell you?\n2. print a summary of the entire dataset; what have you learnt about the data?\n:::\n\nA very convenient way to create a codeplan for a dataset -- especially if it has value-labelled categorical variables -- is offered by the `sjPlot::view_df()` function, which produces a tables in HTML format that can be saved and consulted to get more information about the variables. With the default settings, we get the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsjPlot::view_df(osterman)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe output opens up in the Viewer pane.\n\nThere are several additional options that can add useful complexity to the codeplan, as well as the option to restrict it to selected variables. It also works in a \"piped\" workflow, so it can be combined with {dplyr} verbs such as select to restrict variables beforehand in a more flexible way. Below we request a codeplan with extended options:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsjPlot::view_df(osterman,\n                show.na = TRUE, \n                show.type = TRUE, \n                show.frq = TRUE, \n                show.prc = TRUE, \n                show.string.values = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe output can also be opened in an external web browser window by clicking on the third (last) icon at the top of the Viewer toolbar. From the browser window, with a `Ctrl + Right-click > Save as...` we can save the table as an HTML document locally and use it as a reference.\n\n:::{.task}\n\nBefore moving forward, spend some time examining the codeplan that you have produced and if you haven't yet had a chance to skim through the @Osterman2021CanWeTrustEducationFostering article, have a quick read through their description of the dataset.\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 1: Create some basic descriptive graphs using the `ggplot()` command from the {ggplot2} tidyverse package for the associaton between the following variables:\n1. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’\n2. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’\n3. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘female’\n\n\n## Exercise 2: What factors affect trust?\n\nFit three simple bivariate OLS regressions using the `lm()` function:\n\n1. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘eduyrs25’ and interpret the results\n2. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘agea’ and interpret the results\n3. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘female’ and interpret the results\n4. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on all three predictors listed above and interpret the results\n\n## (Advanced) Exercise 3: Apply the model to a new dataset\n\nThe **ostermann** data originates from Waves 1-9 of the European Social Survey. The ESS data are accessible freely upon registration. As part of this exercise, access data from Wave 10 of the survey (from this site: https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/) and perform the following tasks:\n\n- download the dataset to the Rproject folder\n- select the variables required to recreate the data to fit the multiple regression model from the previous exercise\n- create your version of the ‘trustindex3’ variable\n- fit the models from Exercise 2 and compare the results.\n\nYou should already be familiar with the functions needed to complete each of these steps, but it may require some self-study. You will likely need to continue the task outside class. If you succeed in completing the Task, in Week 3 we can compare results.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\n<i class=\"bi bi-download\"></i> [Download solutions](w2solved.Rmd){download=\"w2solved.Rmd\"}\n\n:::\n\n## SOLUTIONS\n\n### Exercise 1: Create some basic descriptive graphs using the `ggplot()` command from the {ggplot2} tidyverse package for the associaton between the following variables:\n\n1. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’\n\nThe best way to approach this problem is by working through the first examples in Kieran Healy's [*Data Visualization: A practical introduction*](https://socviz.co/), starting at Chapter 3, and applying them to your data. Outside class, you can develop these basic graphs into better looking ones by adding various extra layers. The `ggplot()` function is part of the `{ggplot2}` package, which is included in the core `{tidyverse}`, so we don't need to load it separately if we have already loaded the tidyverse. \n\nThe `ggplot` approach to graphs is to build them up step-by-step using various layers. The basic template code for a `ggplot()` graph is the following:\n\n```\nggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()\n```\n\nFor example, the code below sets up a totally blank canvas:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo start populating the canvas we need to add a first layer containing our dataset and the variables we want to 'map' using the `aes()` argument (for \"aesthetic mapping\"). This adds coordinates to the canvas based on the variables we want to graph (in our case, ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’). We are treating 'trustindex3' as the outcome variables in these exercises, so we will want to position it on the `y` axis:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe now have a basic layer, but no actual data. The final crucial move is to add another layer using the `+` operator the type of graph (called a \"geom\" in ggplot, short for \"geometric object\", such as a bar, a line, a boxplot, histogram, etc.) that we want to use to represent the relationship between the two variables. In this case, given that both variables are measured on a *numeric* scale (or at least on an *ordinal* scale with seven or more categories), the best option is a **scatterplot**. In `ggplot()`, a scatterplot \"geom\" are called with the  `geom_point()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe now have a scatterplot of the relationship between ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’. Because our scales are rather short and the data is spread out, this scatterplot is not very informative.\n\nWe can choose to add another \"geom\" that is better able to summarise the relationship. The function `geom_jitter()` (a shortcut to the specification `geom_point(position = \"jitter\")`) is helpful in such cases because it adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, making areas of overlapping points more visible. The commands below do the same thing:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_jitter()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother option is the `geom_smooth()` function, which provides a set of options, basically returning \"smooth lines\" representing various types of regression lines. The function fits a regression in the background and graphs the results. The default setting is to fit a *generalized additive model* that captures non-linearities in the data with a *smoothing spline* (the Wikipedia article on [GAMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model) gives a maths-heavy outline of these models, but they are beyond our interests here). The smooth line produced is probably more informative about the general idea:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut we can also specify other regression methods, and because we are here aiming to model the relationship between *trust* and *education* as a linear model, we can specify the method as \"lm\":\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we get a straight regression line, which is basically the visual representation of the bivariate linear regression model that we will fit in Exercise 2 below. There are numerous further specifications that can be added to improve the graph, and Healy's book is a good resource for ideas that you can play around with. We won't go into much more detail about these additional options here, but as a taster, let's say that we want to make the regression line more pronounced by changing its colour to *red* and make the scatter dots slightly transparent by adjusting the colour's \"alpha\" level:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’\n\nWe can now do something similar for the relationship between *trust* and *age* (the ‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’ variables in the dataset). Again, both variables are measured on a *numeric* scale, so a scatterplot should work best. Because we don't know what to expect and therefore what additional settings would improve each individual graph, we start from the most basic informative layer and build up from there. To practice some alternative approaches to working with plots, here we will first save the basic plot as a **ggplot object**, to which we can later add further layers and specifications:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nage_plot <- ggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = agea)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf no output was generated from the command above, that's as expected. The graph was produced, but we didn't ask for it to be printed, we only asked for it to be saved as an object called \"age_plot\". To see it, we can simply call \"age_plot\". We can then make various additions to this plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nage_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis looks very similar to the previous graph, so we could add the same additional specificaitons as in the previous exercise, this time to the plot object that we saved:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nage_plot +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe association between age and trust appears very weak, something that we will explore further in Exercise 2.\n\n3. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘female’\n\nWe can try a similar scatterplot here too, but there may be better options:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis graph can be confusing, are we are better off using another \"geom\" because the *female* variable is a dichotomous/binary factor (categorical) variable. A good visualisation tool in the this case is a boxplot, which can be called with the `geom_boxplot()` function. There will be a challenge, though:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheets_w02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe issue with this graph is that the **female** variable is recognised as numeric by `R`. What we need to do first - or, as part of the `ggplot()` function itself - is to tell `R` to treat ***female** as a factor.

Regress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘eduyrs25’ and interpret the results\n\nWe will do just that, saving the regression as an object called \"m1\" (for *model 1*):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1 <- lm(trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25, data = osterman)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe model object has now been saved in the Environment, and we can inspect it manually if we want by opening it in the Source window. The object is a large list, with various components that we can call and print separately. The most basic information that we can obtain from the model is the coefficients:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncoefficients(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(Intercept)    eduyrs25 \n  3.9085904   0.1054227 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThis basic information is enough to solve the linear equation underpinning the model:\n\n$$ y_i=b_0+b_1x_i $$\nThe coefficients correspond to the $b$'s in this simple model, and we can plug the values in to obtain\n\n$$ trust_i=3.91 + 0.11 \\times education_i $$\n\nWe find, thus, that the number of years spent in education has a positive outcome on social trust, with each additional year of education associated with a 0.11-points higher score on the trust index, above the baseline of 3.91 points in the case when education is equal to 0. With this formula we can calculate predictions of the *trust* score for any individual $i$ from their years of education.\n\nWe can also get more information about the model with the `summary()` function. When applied to a linear model object, it provides the following output:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25, data = osterman)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-6.5442 -1.1737  0.1426  1.2992  6.0914 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Several user-written functions exist to improve on this output. For example, the [`{broom}`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package - part of the [`{tidymodels}`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) suite of packages - has functions to extract model information into \"tidy\" tibbles (data sets), which can then be further manipulated and plotted. This is especially useful when working with results from many models that would benefit from comparing in a standardised format.\n\nThe [`{sjPlot}`](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/tab_model_estimates.html) package that we used before also has functions to export a publishable-quality table in HTML format:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsjPlot::tab_model(m1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none;\">\n<tr>\n<th style=\"border-top: double; text-align:center; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold; padding:0.2cm;  text-align:left; \">&nbsp;</th>\n<th colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-top: double; text-align:center; font-style:normal; font-weight:bold; padding:0.2cm; \">trustindex 3</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\" text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal;  text-align:left; \">Predictors</td>\n<td style=\" text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal;  \">Estimates</td>\n<td style=\" text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal;  \">CI</td>\n<td style=\" text-align:center; border-bottom:1px solid; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal;  \">p</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:left; \">(Intercept)</td>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:center;  \">3.91</td>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:center;  \">3.86&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;3.95</td>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:center;  \"><strong>&lt;0.001</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:left; \">eduyrs25</td>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:center;  \">0.11</td>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:center;  \">0.10&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;0.11</td>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:center;  \"><strong>&lt;0.001</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:left; padding-top:0.1cm; padding-bottom:0.1cm; border-top:1px solid;\">Observations</td>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; padding-top:0.1cm; padding-bottom:0.1cm; text-align:left; border-top:1px solid;\" colspan=\"3\">68211</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; text-align:left; padding-top:0.1cm; padding-bottom:0.1cm;\">R<sup>2</sup> / R<sup>2</sup> adjusted</td>\n<td style=\" padding:0.2cm; text-align:left; vertical-align:top; padding-top:0.1cm; padding-bottom:0.1cm; text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\">0.054 / 0.054</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy default the output table shows 95% confidence intervals (CI) instead of standard errors (SE), which can be easier to interpret (CI are calculated as *Estimate +/- (1.96 x Std. Error)*; you can try it out in the Console, replacing in the numeric values).\n\nThe best approach is to graph the model results and present them in a figure, but that's not very informative in the case of a simple model with only one predictor, so we can leave it for later.\n\n2.

The ESS data are accessible freely upon registration. As part of this exercise, access data from Wave 10 of the survey (from this site: https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/) and perform the following tasks:\n\n- download the dataset to the Rproject folder\n- select the variables required to recreate the data to fit the multiple regression model from the previous exercise\n- create your version of the ‘trustindex3’ variable\n- fit the models from Exercise 2 and compare the results.\n\nYou should already be familiar with the functions needed to complete each of these steps, but it may require some self-study. The most important missing information required to compete this task is to be found in the description on how the **trustindex3** scale was computed provided by Osterman:\n\n>To study generalized social trust, I am following the established approach of using a validated three-item scale (Reeskens and Hooghe 2008; Zmerli and Newton 2008). This scale consists of the classic trust question, an item on whether people try to be fair, and an item on whether people are helpful: <br>\n- ‘Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?’ <br>\n- ‘Do you think that most people would try to take advantage of you if they got the chance, or would they try to be fair?’ <br>\n- ‘Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or that they are mostly looking out for themselves?’ <br>\nAll of the items may be answered on a scale from 0 to 10 (where 10 represents the highest level of trust) and the scale is calculated as the mean of the three items. The three-item scale clearly improves measurement reliability and cross-country validity compared to using a single item, such as the classic trust question. Internal consistency for the three items is reasonably high (Cronbach’s alpha: 0.77). The scale ranges between 0 and 10 with a mean of 5.24 for my sample. See the Supplementary material for additional information on the construction of the social trust scale (Section A.1), as well as for models using the classic single-item measure of trust (Section A.9).\n\n<br>\n\n<< the end >>\n\n<br>\n\n\n",
