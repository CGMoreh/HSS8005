### Prerequisites

To benefit the most from this module, students are expected to have a foundational level of knowledge in quantitative methods: a good understanding of data types and distributions, familiarity with inferential statistics, and some exposure to linear regression. This is roughly equivalent to the content covered in the [Introductory stream](https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/45661/pages/intro-stream-roadmap) of the module or a textbook such as [OpenIntro Statistics (which you can download for free in PDF)](https://leanpub.com/os).

Those who don't feel completely up to date with linear regression but are determined to advance more quickly and read/practice beyond the compulsory material during weeks 1-3 are also encouraged to sign up.

Those with a stronger background in multiple linear regression (e.g. students with undergraduate-level training in econometrics) will still benefit from weeks 1-3 as the approach we are taking is probably different from the one they are familiar with.

The module has a strong focus on practical data analysis using the open-source {{< fa brands r-project size="1x">}} statistical programming language (with a focus on the {{< iconify simple-icons tidyverse size="1x">}}`{tidyverse}` dialect). **No previous knowledge of {{< fa brands r-project size="1x">}} or command-based statistical analysis software is needed.** Gaining basic experience with using {{< fa brands r-project size="1x">}} via the <!-- <iconify-icon inline icon="file-icons:rstudio" style="color: #7dbefc;"></iconify-icon>**Studio** API --> [![](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RStudio-Logo-flat.svg){fig-alt="RStudio" width=50px}](https://www.rstudio.com) API is part of the skills development aims of the module. 
But this is not a general data science module, and the IT labs will cover a very limited number of functions (from both base `R`, the `tidyverse` and other reliable user-written [packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)) that are most useful for tackling specific analysis tasks. Students are advised to complete some additional self-paced free online training in the use of the software, such as Data Carpentry’s [**R for Social Scientists**](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), and to consult Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund's [**R for Data Science** (2nd ed.)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) online book.
