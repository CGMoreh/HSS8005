### Module overview

This module is offered by {{< var institution.red >}} to postgraduate students within the {{< var institution.hass >}} at {{< var institution.name >}}. The module aims to provide a broad applied introduction to more advanced methods in quantitative analysis for students from various disciplinary backgrounds. See the [module plan](plan8.qmd) page for details about the methods covered. The course content consists of eight lectures (1.5 hours each) and eight IT labs (1.5 hours) . The course stands on three pillars: *application*, *reproducibility* and *computation.*

**Application:** we will work with real data originating from large-scale representative surveys or published research, with the aim of applying methods to concrete research scenarios. IT lab exercises will involve reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. The aim is to see how methods have been used in practice in various disciplines and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable students to apply this knowledge to their own research questions. The data used in IT labs may be cleansed to allow focusing more on modelling tasks than on data wrangling, but exercises will address some of the more common data manipulation challenges and will cover essential functions. Data cleansing scripts will also be provided so that interested students can use them in their own work.

**Reproducibility:** developing a reproducible workflow that allows your future self or a reviewer of your work to understand your process of analysis and reproduce your results is essential for reliable and collaborative scientific research. We enforce the ideas and procedures of reproducible research both through replicating published research (see above) and in our practice (in the IT labs and the [assignment](../assessment/assignment.qmd)). For an overview of why it's important to develop a reproducible workflow early on in your research career and how to do it using (some) of the tools used in this module, read [Chapter 3 of **TSD**](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/03-workflow.html) (see [Resources>Readings](/resources)). It's also worth reading through Kieran Healy's [*The Plain Person's Guide to Plain Text Social Science*](https://plain-text.co/), although there are now better software options than those discussed there. In this course, we will be using a suite of well-integrated free and open-source software to aid our reproducible workflow: the [![](/files/img/R_logo.png){fig-alt="R" height="17px"}](https://cloud.r-project.org/) statistical programming language and its currently most popular dialect -- the {{< iconify simple-icons tidyverse size="1.3x">}}`{tidyverse}` -- via the [![](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RStudio-Logo-flat.svg){fig-alt="RStudio" height="18px"}](https://www.rstudio.com) IDE for data analysis, and [![](/files/img/quarto_icon.png){fig-alt="Quarto" height="19px"}](https://quarto.org/) for scientific writing and publishing (see [Resources>Software](/resources)).

**Computation:** the development of computational methods underpins the application of *the most important statistical ideas of the past 50 years* (see Andrew Gelman's article on these developments [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/stat50.pdf) or an online workshop talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6ha2UeSZbo);  Richard McElreath's great talk on [*Science as Amateur Software Development*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwRdO9_GGhY) is well worth watching too). This module aims to develop basic computational skills that allow the application of complex statistical models to practical scientific problems without advanced mathematical knowledge, and which lay the foundation on which students can then pursue further learning and research in computational humanities and social sciences.
