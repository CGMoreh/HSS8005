#### Compulsory readings

**Textbooks**

The course does not strictly follow the content of a textbook, but the expectation is that students will read as much as possible of the assigned chapters from the following two books, both freely available to download or read online:

These books provide relatively introductory material to statistical modelling, but from a fresh perspective. Relatively large portions of text will be assigned for reading in each week, referring to them by their acronyms. [Don't worry if you cannot read all the textbook content assigned in any given week!]{.underline} Those for whom the method covered by the assigned readings is new, will be able to refer back to them throughout the semester and beyond, reading thoroughly and completing the applied exercises. Those already familiar to some extent with the methods, should nonetheless read the text as a narrative and will discover hidden gems that will spectacularly improve their understanding and ability to interpret their statistical results.

**Applied methods**

In the IT labs we will practice applying methods by reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. To fully understand the context of these data and the methods used, you must read the original journal articles and the available supplementary materials provided alongside. These readings will be listed under each week's outline (still work in progress!).

The articles come from a variety of different fields, so expect them to push you outside your disciplinary comfort zone. The point is to see how methods have been used in practice and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable you to apply this knowledge to your own research questions.

When selecting the articles, the aim was to strike a fine balance between (a) the simplicity of the methods employed, (b) data and analytical transparency, and (c) the strength of the analysis. So don't take them as examples of all-rounds best practice, but examples of research that gets published while being self-confident enough to open itself up for public scrutiny. Aim for this in your own research!
