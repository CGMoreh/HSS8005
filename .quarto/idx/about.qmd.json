We will look back on the development of some core statistical concepts and learn about the ideas and preoccupations that influenced them  over three centuries. The aim of this overview is to build up essential intuition about the concepts and methods that we will learn about later.  The outcome will be a much clearer understanding of the limits of statistical analysis and the dangers of not acknowledging those limits.  \n**The IT lab**, on the other hand, will provide a very hands-on practical introduction to the {{< fa brands r-project size=\"1x\">}}  statistical programming language and its currently most popular dialect -- the {{< iconify simple-icons tidyverse size=\"1x\">}}`{tidyverse}` -- via  the <!-- {{< iconify simple-icons rstudio size=\"1x\">}} !!
