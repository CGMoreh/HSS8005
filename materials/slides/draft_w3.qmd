## What is simple (bivariate) linear regression?

- **Simple**: it involves one *response* (dependent; outcome) variable and only one *explanatory* (independent; predictor) variable

- **Linear**: we assume that a one-unit change in the independent variable leads to a certain amount of increase or decrease in the dependent variable

- **Regression**: the term originated in Francis Galton's studies of biological inheritance, specifically his 1886 article “Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature", published in the *Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland* (vol. 15, pp. 246–263)

- At its simplest, it helps us evaluate whether there is a linear relationship between a *numerical* variable on a horizontal axis and the average of a *numerical* variable on the vertical axis. It provides a mathematical solution to the question: what is the *best fitting* straight line to capture the relationship of two variables in a *scatter plot*?


## What is simple (bivariate) linear regression?

- A statistical method for fitting a line to data where the relationship between two variables, $x$ and $y,$ can be modeled by a straight line with some error:

### $$  \overbrace{\color{green}{\textbf{y}}}^{outcome} = b_0 + b_1 * \overbrace{\color{green}{\textbf{x}}}^{predictor} + e$$

- A dataset normally contains a collection of values for $y$ and $x$ from a number $(N)$ of cases (e.g. survey respondents, or another unit of analysis)
- For example, each row $i$ in a dataset containing $N=1\dots{n}$ cases/units/rows would store values for $y_i$ and $x_i$
- so that: 

### $$ y_i=b_0+b_1x_i + e_i $$



## What is simple (bivariate) linear regression?

### $$  \overbrace{\color{green}{\textbf{y}}}^{outcome} = \overbrace{\color{red}{b_0}}^{intercept} + \overbrace{\color{red}{b_1}}^{slope} * \overbrace{\color{green}{\textbf{x}}}^{predictor} + \overbrace{e}^{error;\ residual} $$

- our aim is to calculate values for the $b_0$ and $b_1$ based on our data
- the intercept $b_0$ (or $\alpha$, as it is also sometimes notated) represents the average value of $y$ when $x$ is zero
- the slope $b_1$ measures the average increase in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit
- together, $b_0$ and $b_1$ together are called *coefficients*
- the error term $e$ allows an observation to deviate from a perfect linear relationship
- More generally, our aim is to generalise from our *sample* data to a hypothetical *population*. The mathematical notation to describe this general case is:

$$ Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1*X+\epsilon $$



## What is simple (bivariate) linear regression?


For example, say we have data on two variables, $X$ and $Y$; both are continuous measures with means of 0.48 and 0.006, respectively, and some standard deviation (i.e. they have variation among values):

## What are the aims of regression analysis?

- ** Prediction**: we can use regression to predict an outcome variable, or more precisely the distribution of the outcome, given some set of inputs (i.e. predictors)

- ** Comparison**: we can also compare these predictions for different values
of the inputs, to make simple comparisons between groups, or to estimate causal effects (ROS, p. 81)


## Applied regression

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(ggformula)
library(kableExtra)
```

Data from Österman (2021) "Can We Trust Education for Fostering Trust? Quasi-experimental Evidence on the Effect of Education and Tracking on Social Trust"

```{r}
#| eval: false
osterman <- sjlabelled::read_stata("https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005-data/osterman.dta")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
osterman <- sjlabelled::read_stata("../../data/osterman.dta")
```




- cumulative European Social Survey (ESS) data, consisting
of the nine rounds from 2002 to 2018

- data are weighted using ESS design weights (we will disregard this, sowe can expect our results to always differ somewhat!)

- follows 'the established approach of using a validated three-item scale' to study generalised social trust

- data also includes twenty-seven educational reforms implemented in sixteen European countries over six decades, where for each reform we can compare earlier reform-unaffected cohorts with later reform-affected cohorts


## Applied regression

Data from Österman (2021) "Can We Trust Education for Fostering Trust? Quasi-experimental Evidence on the Effect of Education and Tracking on Social Trust"

- The scale consists of the classic trust question, an item on whether people try to be fair, and an
item on whether people are helpful:
  - ‘Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?’
  - ‘Do you think that most people would try to take advantage of you if they got the chance, or would they try to be fair?’
    - ‘Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or that they are mostly looking out for themselves?’
    
- All of the items may be answered on a scale from 0 to 10 (where 10 represents the highest level of trust) and the scale is calculated as the mean of the three items

- The three-item scale improves measurement reliability and cross-country validity compared to using a single item, such as the classic trust question.

## Does education predict trust?

- A scatter-plot of 'trustindex3' by 'eduyrs25'

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gf_point(trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25, data = osterman) %>%
  gf_lm() + theme_light()
```


## Does education predict trust?
```{r}
m_edu <- lm(trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25, data = osterman)
summary(m_edu)
```


## Does age predict trust?
```{r echo=FALSE}
gf_point(trustindex3 ~ agea, data = osterman) %>%
  gf_lm() + theme_light()
```


## Does age predict trust?

```{r}
m_age <- lm(trustindex3 ~ agea, data = osterman)
summary(m_age)
```


## Does gender predict trust?
```{r echo=FALSE}
gf_point(trustindex3 ~ female, data = osterman) %>%
  gf_lm() + theme_light()
```


## Does gender predict trust?

```{r}
m_gender <- lm(trustindex3 ~ female, data = osterman)
summary(m_gender)
```


## Multiple linear regression

- it allows us to test the joint effects of more than one predictor

- usually, we are interested in one primary predictor, but *while taking into account*, or *holding constant* the values of other predictors
- it allows us to account for the possible effect of other factors (variables) that may influence our regression results

- the multiple regression model for $p$ number of predictors can be written as:
#### $$  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ X_1 + \beta_2 \ X_2 + \beta_3 \ X_3 + \dots + \beta_p \ X_p + e $$

- but visualising it is a bit more difficult...
