## Aims

In this session we continue working with data from @Osterman2021CanWeTrustEducationFostering to replicate parts their analysis. In Week 2 we practised building very basic bivariate and multiple linear regression models. In this session, we will expand on those models and attempt to replicate (some of) the models reported in [**Table 3**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-020-02529-y/tables/3) of @Osterman2021CanWeTrustEducationFostering:

## Setup

In Week 1 you set up `R` and `RStudio`, and an **RProject** folder (we called it "HSS8005_labs") with an `.R` script and a `.qmd` or `.Rmd` document in it (we called these "Lab_1"). Ideally, you saved this on a cloud drive so you can access it from any computer (e.g. OneDrive). You will be working in this folder. If it's missing, complete [Task 2 from the Week 1 Lab](https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005/materials/worksheets/worksheets_w01.html#task-2-set-up-a-new-r-project-with-an-.r-script-and-a-.qmd-document-included).

You can create a new `.R` script and `.qmd`/`.Rmd` for this week's work (e.g. "Lab_3"). It may be useful to document more of your coding process and interpretations, so you want to work in a `.qmd`/`.Rmd` document rather than an `.R` script.




## Import data

As a first step, let's import the **osterman** dataset that underpins the @Osterman2021CanWeTrustEducationFostering article (see the [Data page](https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005/data/) on the course website for information about the datasets available in this course):

```{r}
#| output: false
osterman <- sjlabelled::read_stata("https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005-data/osterman.dta")
```




## Modelling challenges

To continue on from the toy models that we fitted in Lab2, we may remember that 


```{r}
#osterman <- 

m0 <- lm(trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25 + agea + female + eduyrs25:female, data = osterman)

summary(m0)


plot_model(m0, type = "pred", terms = c("eduyrs25", "female"))



```

```{r}
interactions::interact_plot(m0, pred = eduyrs25, modx = female)
```
